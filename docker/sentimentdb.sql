16	mvi5vv0	Honestly I like the concept of Game Pass. I get wanting to own the license to a game, but game pass lets me play games without necessarily committing to paying for it. If I decide I like it, I can buy the license to own it on my console later, which I usually end up doing so I can have it and play it whenever. If I don‚Äôt, nothing lost except time. Game pass actually led to me purchasing the Banner Saga games, Mechwarrior 5, and Call of Cthulhu. It also let me play RDR2 until I could afford to buy the game on a discount.

26	mvi61a0	The short answer is that the vaginal canal has its own microbiome susceptible to infection. In the same way that your mouth can have a yeast (or "thrush") infection (or bacterial infection for that matter), so can the vaginal canal. It happens to everyone at some point. It can be influenced by things as simple as using the wrong soap in sensitive areas and your diet, or things more damaging things like using products like douches. Taking antibiotics can trigger a yeast infection but so can having your pH levels off.	Juvenalesque	1	2025-06-01 23:57:21	Showerthoughts	f	\N	\N	t1_mvhnpul	t3_1l0volg	2025-06-01 23:57:33.572202

I'll just get it on sale in a year like I did Doom Eternal.\n\nThen you look on steam and see that there's like 50K people playing Expedition 33 and 10K people playing Doom.

41	mvi69fk	You work for money, more time spent working = more money. You buying a more expensive new game means you spent more time to buy the game. Now because it's a new game you'll probably spend more time getting it to work properly because todays games need a couple patches before they work, so you spent more time. \nIf you waited, you would spend less money on a more optimized version of the game with dlc that you can play in one go, shaving some more time off by not reinstalling to play dlc.  Game will also take the same amount of time to complete, perhaps less, because bugs and crashes will  be fixed.\nYou say you don't want to waste time, but that's exactly what you are doing when you buy games new, so your argument is invalid.

178	mvibi9i	I'm wondering if it's elderly grandparents of the borrowers who co-signed student loans to help their grandchildren go to university. I used to work for a big student loan servicer and most grandparents who did this really did not have a full understanding that if their grandchildren stopped paying that the lenders could go after them too. Most of them were vulnerable and being taken advantage of by their grandchildren who would lie to them. It was really sad.	cabinetsnotnow	1	2025-06-02 00:30:56	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvi2f22	t3_1l0rjzw	2025-06-02 00:31:15.343556

But I kept thinking that If Cyberpunk wanted to claim the first "Quadruple A" game it absolutely would've earned it. It's still in a league of its own in my opinion. Nothing has ever come close.

IMHO they didn't capitalise on the franchise and art part of the game.  \nSure. The meteorite powder making the cards animated did cost money. But the real possibilties was in alternate card art with voiceovers. Additional soundtracks. The cast of characters to be made into journeys.

I went to a really good high school where I was on the honors track for English up until my senior year. I dropped AP English second semester because the homework was too much for me to keep up with, (I also had undiagnosed ADHD at the time-great fun) but when I got to college my English classes were less demanding and intensive than my high school ones. I actually found myself more engaged in my other gen ed classes that had nothing to do with my major because I was actually learning stuff. With my literature courses, I was just bored out of my skull. I'm sorry, but if I have to read The Lottery for five different fucking classes, I think I have the right to question what the fuck I'm doing here.

I had recently gotten a legendary weapon that I wanted so I didn't want to load an older save. \n\nSo what happened was basically me stuck in an Edge of Tomorrow situation where I'd load the save and have about one second to escape the mini nuke. I tried sprinting in a random direction- boom. Shooting the mini nuke? Boom. Jumping? Boom. Taking 20 doses of med-x and rad-x? Boom. \n\nWhat ended up working was using kind of glitching vats out to slow time for a sec then jam every single drug into my body including jet which slowed down time and then I just ran and managed to survive with like 1 HP. But I probably spend an hour in that timeloop hell.	ThisIsTheNewSleeve	1	2025-06-02 12:27:45	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1ft5q	t3_1l1ft5q	2025-06-02 12:27:59.682912

Ukraine sneaks in a swarm of murder drones next to an air field, then there will be stronger anti-drone defenses on all Russian facilities within a month.\n\nThe one advantage that this gives Ukraine is that Russia can't magically conjure better defenses out of thin air and will have to divert recourses from elsewhere to better secure facilities.

347	mvkt7co	Yeah I agree.¬† There are some good points to playing a game closer to release: discovering the world along with other players or experiencing a game as it changes during it's most exciting period.¬† I remember playing games like Animal Well or Elden Ring (or even recently have been seeing this with Expedition 33) when they were released and learning the game along with the rest of the world is really interesting a create a unique sense of community.¬† This is especially true for online games like Helldivers 2,¬† Space Marine 2, Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, etc., that are also experiencing new content or reacting to changes to the game with you.¬† Yeah the jokes and memes and discussions will always exist online, but it's really fun to see them on your feed as you're experiencing the game with everyone else.\n\n\nA bit more abstractly, I do think it's also good to support devs that are making games you enjoy.¬† I am aware that buying a game super cheap years later isn't generally going to help a studio that has now closed down (a recent example of this is PoP: the Lost Crown and probably a million indie games.)¬†¬†\n\n\nFor me, there's a good middle ground here between buying a new game that I'm excited for and picking up a well maintained older game.¬† Never is absolutely correct and both can lead to great experiences if you're thoughtful about the games you're playing.

357	mvktc90	It took me 4 years to get approved for SSDI & I was unable to work for most of them. We had to downsize & move to be able to survive on a single income. The first time I applied, I was sent to one of their doctors & denied, because they believed I could work with reasonable accommodations. I reached out to a few disability lawyers, but none of them were willing to take my case, but one advised me to take the time to build more medical records & treatment/therapy records. After about a year I applied again & still ended up getting denied. I appealed twice & that's when I could finally request a judge. I had to be driven to the county courthouse to appear in person & once I was actually able to explain my case in full, it was approved. You basically have to be dependent on the care of another to be able to qualify for disability because it's impossible to support yourself when you're stuck waiting years to get approved for it. It's a rigged system.	neonlexicon	1	2025-06-02 12:32:34	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvkmh7w	t3_1l0rjzw	2025-06-02 12:32:47.256239

PIS and the catholic church in Poland thought that if they restricted abortion, people would have children again. As you can see, that was not the case. Abortion was never the problem and it should be legal. The problem is that people are too individualistic and selfish, focusing on their careers instead of starting families.

403	mvktuqq	You are so weird lmao, so because I don't like cyberpunk, I must be not good enough to play on the very hard difficulty. What is this logic. I don't like build crafting and I don't like feeling strong. For example when I play games like Dark Souls or Elden Ring I intentionally heavily underlevel to force my self to practically no hit bosses while keeping my build as barebones as possible so I know it's all me and that I'm not being carried by items and levels. At the same time, I don't like tedium, so very hard just makes it take longer.   \n  \nI bought all the cyberpunk upgrades and then you just became a death machine and there's no point so I didn't use them, I don't think 'build crafting' is really a skill, you just equip the items that synergize and then it works. I'd argue having to make spreadsheets and minmax just to kill the enemies in cyberpunk is ridicolous and unessecary. Anyone can make a rpg character that is overpowered, that just isn't fun for me. What is the point of playing if I'm just going to delete the enemies.\n\nI said it before, but I'm literally one of the best in world at shooter games, I hit top rank in all the games I play. When you're used to fighting top tier shooter players, I don't need Cyberpunk to challenge me. I also didn't complain about dying too quickly either, I just said it's a fact that the difficultly just adjusts how qucikly the enemies can kill you, and how long it takes to kill them. That's why I don't play on the highest, there's no point if I'm already uninterested in a boring combat system to force myself to endure it longer or spend time making a build for combat I don't even like. \n\nCyberpunk is a casual action shooting game, I'm playing to for the RPG story(which wasn't that good), not for high octane combat(which the game notably lacks), because then I'd play ultra-nightmare Doom Eternal or Ultrakill or I'd fight real people in CoD scrims literally any actually difficult shooter game.

410	mvktxlx	I am so surprised they force games out, publishers/ devs...it has such a negative effect if the game is not ready by release date.  All of the people who won't touch a bad release until it's half price if ever at all surely is more damaging.  It is to me at least.\n\nLords of the fallen was pretty fun, devs worked so hard improving th game and you can see the  passion and care.  I look forward to a sequel building on the games weaknesses.  But why on earth release it in that state...I know it's a battle of money but it just seems more damaging in the long term. I may look at their sales, I played on game pass a month ago...just lucky 2.0 had just come out.\n\nI think overalls games are in a severe phase of struggling on a larger scale.  Still some absolute gems out there but so much homogenization, loss of creativity and risk.

If you're still failing after two attempts and need me to come help, I'll be coming with my healer and let you lead.\n\nDone this many, many times over my long gaming career.

And lots of competition. All because Wall Street was allowed to become greedier under Republican ideology under Reagan, which understood that employees no longer deserve the spoils of business success, and *only* belong to the stockholders. The auto industry and suppliers were being decimated by the Japanese. Union membership falling so increasing competition. There was a boom in computer employment later only because of the transition from typewriters and later the web. And a lot of screaming about Buy American as the factory jobs and tech began to shift to asia.

475	mvkv2yv	So, previous right-wing government passed a lot of.. controversial to say the least.. bills. Including making our already strict abortion law even more strict, to a point it's currently almost banned. They also created their own "branches" in the judicary system, as well as cemented their own parlimentary court, making sure to a big extent that untangling it would be extremely hard.\n\nIn 2023 they lost power, and our current government promised they'd fix what the previous ones have broken, they would abolish their unlawful bills, and prosecute those responsible. This has not happened yet. In part because the ruling coalition was bickering, and in part because the president that is now departing was from that right-wing party and would either veto any bill, or send it to parlimentary court where it'd sit indefinitely. And any prosecution wouldn't matter either because president has pardon power.\n\nThis elections were a chance to finally start those changes - without the president that would auto-veto those important bills..\n\nBut now it's all gone. New president is even more right-wing that the old one, and is defo gonna be a pain in the arse for the govt. They will not pass aby significant bill for the rest of their term. No chance to deliver any reforms they promised, no chance for prosecutions.\n\nAnd in 2 years we'll have parlimentary elections. The right wing now-opposition will defo use the fact the current government hasn't delivered any promises to again get back in power. And then Poland will be on the same course as Orban' Hungary.... Eurosceptics, that for the sake of internal politics will be a massive pain in the EU's back..\n\nJust like they were in their previous 2 terms..

Universities differ from colleges in that they offer Masters and PhD level study, which are dedicated to developing specialist knowledge through focussed research. College stops at BA/BS and is taught: BA and below students are not expected to make meaningful contributions to their fields of study, they're just supposed to absorb and use pre-existing knowledge. MA and above are supposed to develop new information and share it throughout their field.	yankonapc	1	2025-06-02 12:48:57	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvjx0vx	t3_1l0rjzw	2025-06-02 12:49:13.314936

535	mvkw14v	I randomly saved just before a big boss battle in Deus Ex. I had been focusing mostly on stealth and physical upgrades rather than any sort of gun fighting stuff, and had barely any ammo on me. After a few deaths to the boss, I figured out the apparent "trick" needed to kill the boss, which required an amount of ammo I didn't have... \n\nSomehow after a dozen or so attempts I figured out a way to make it work, but that was one of the worst experiences of my most recent save state screwing me over, and the save state before that one was a little *too* far back for my liking. So instead of taking the like, hour to get back to where I was...I slammed my head against the wall, shoved the square block into the triangle hole, and pressed on. \n\nGreat game.

It certainly doesn't help that things are objectively getting shittier for us, too.\n\nI'm of a similar mindset when it comes to buyer's remorse. If I may, I recommend a service called Gamefly, which is basically Netflix for games. I hardly ever buy video games since I don't think the full price is worth the time spent playing them. But with a flat monthly fee, I get to try every game out there on the market for my console. When I'm bored with them, I return em for the next thing. They've got movies, too! Plus, during the holiday season, they give out huge coupons for yearly purchases, so I basically paid off the next two years for a fraction of the total price.\n\nBut hey, as long as you find ways to enjoy yourself in life, that's all that really matters.

591	mvkwpva	Falsely calling it a genocide is precisely what leads to unhinged lunatics like this guy going to peace rallies support of releasing hostages--and setting people on fire.\n\nWhat Israel is doing is ordinary warfare that's no different than any other war in history. However Hamas's strategy is to rack up as many dead civilians as possible and so they place all their military/attack infrastructure behind civilians. This isn't some loophole to avoid being blown up, Israel is allowed to strike military targets. \n\nThere are 2,300,000 gazans, if we take Hamas's own numbers of 60,000 dead, this is about 2% of the population after 2 years of heavy conflict in the most densely populated place on earth. Not all of these 60k are civilian, most are Hamas fighters killed in combat. IDF estimates 30k. \n\nAgain: not a genocide. Warfare. \n\nIf you were alive in 1944 and being algorithmically fed videos of german children being pulled from ruble--you'd be whining that the Allies are "going to far" and "Allies are committing genocide" and demanding a ceasefire.

618	mvkx2xk	The game is pretty much the definition of average, nothing too special about it, but detailed enough that you can't call it bad either.\n\nIt got a lot of hate on release, either because it didn't resonate with Dragon Age fans (it kinda goes in a different direction gameplay wise) or because it offended some snowflakes (it had one cutscene where genders were discussed and some people had a mental breakdown over it).\n\nIf you look past those unwarranted criticisms, you'll find a game with a great presentation (visuals and audio are on point), a questline that definitely picks up near the end and some variety between classes. On the downside, the game holds your hand a lot so don't expect any real challenges. It's very plausible that you'll finish the game without even dying once. And for the first few hours, the game really likes to overexplain itself and the plot to the point it might get annoying. Luckily, that goes away and the tempo eventually picks up.

630	mvkx79a	They never did. Vivendi bought Blizzard early on. Bobby Kotick (CEO of Activision) wanted control of WoW, so he negotiated to sell Activision to Vivendi in order to achieve control. Vivendi held him on short leash for a while, formally merging Activision with Blizzard but with majority owner control at Vivendi, leaving Blizzard in control of their own fate. Kotick eventually organized a deal to buy back Activision-Blizzard from Vivendi in 2013. This left him in control of Blizzard.\n\nI don't think the original Blizzard team would ever have old out to Bobby Kotick. His reputation in the business was abysmal even before the Epstein rumors surfaced. It was a condition of Microsoft's purchase of Activision that Kotick would be out - they don't want him there.	kf97mopa	1	2025-06-02 12:56:31	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvkndu9	t3_1l1ex82	2025-06-02 12:56:44.270204
631	mvkx79o	As a person that went through school during the 80s, the student loan debt was pushed onto us as a debt that would be paid off in 10 years. Personally my loans were 8.5% -9.25% , which was low interest for the time. I paid for a decade and owed 2X the amount I borrowed and then fought over a decade to have it discharged due to disability. It was finally discharged 14 years after I could no longer work. Then I was charged 12,000 in taxes for the ‚Äúwritten off debt‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have the money to pay back. More than a decade later the tax liens are still on my home.	misfortunesangel	1	2025-06-02 12:56:31	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvfn0jz	t3_1l0rjzw	2025-06-02 12:56:44.779342

It appears to have broken some people's brains because you can be trans or non-binary, and some people cannot get over the fact it's not Origins. But as someone whose been playing DA since the beginning of the franchise, I find it's still a great game to play and it's got an amazing final act.	ciderandcake	1	2025-06-02 12:57:01	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1h4vf	t3_1l1h4vf	2025-06-02 12:57:21.196727

700	mvkyf9c	B-but how can I make my own opinion without having others telling me how I should feel?\n\nI swear, man, social media has been conditioning people to be afraid of forming an unpopular opinion and being afraid of backlash on any damn topic.\n\nIt used to be that if you didn't like something, you'd say it to your small friend group and that would be it, but now it's a whole circlejerk in huge groups that whine about niche things that change nothing about their lives, and then before you know it that opinion becomes your whole identity, and everyone who disagrees is a threat.\n\nIn this case people complained a lot about the game, but people also complained a lot about stuff that doesn't really affect gameplay at all, or like in Starfield, where people complained that if you pressed a specific button on the character creation menu you could change your pronouns. Like dude, just don't press the button then?\n\nStarfield sucks ass for a lot of reasons (mostly the loading screens and performance to be fair), but people always find stupid hills to die on.\n\nI agree with you. OP should just download the game and see if they enjoy it. If they hate it, just delete the game and move on, no one died. If they love it, they will have a good time, no one dies either.

768	mvkzpgf	I hadn't bought a single game on release besides BG3 in the last 4 years. I absolutely refuse to because AAA studios and the likes have been nothing but let downs. The only reason I bought BG3 is because I knew Larian games and have played the piss out of Divinity with friends and guess what? I was right to trust that studio because BG3 IS A BANGER. I also bought Clair Obscure about a week after release because everyone seemed to be very satisfied with it which also ended up being a great worthwhile purchase. \n\nAs for everything else. I have still yet to purchase any other games that were released last year and this year. I will very likely continue this trend as I can just load up a F2P hero shooter in Marvel Rivals or play one of my many games I own from sales that I paid $4 for or something along those lines. \n\nRushing to buy games on release makes you the fool when all they ever are is horrendous on launch but to each their own.

I decided to give that game a chance, I really tried and... it was as bad as people were saying. Bland characters that felt they have the same personality, like all of them were collective consciousness, uninspiring combat and pacing of the story was dogshit. Yes, let's argue about pronouns when cities are burning and world is ending. \n\nBut I may be overly harsh because, as I said. As soon as I dropped veilguard I started playing a game that is opposite of Veilguard in pretty much every aspect. \n\n\nThe world was pretty nice though!

You just interpreted that in a literal sense (or you chose to be a pedant...).\n\nObviously, not *literally everyone* played them. But they were really really huge. So huge that they broke out of just the gaming niche (and back then gaming was a niche) and everyone at least have heard of them.\n\nHeck, I remember when Diablo 3 launched and everyone was standing everywhere in the world at huge queues to get it. The news channels reported on it and how long it has been since Diablo 2. That never happened before OR after for anything gaming related.

Only started playing these for the first time recently and have to say I am sad that I missed out on these back when they first came out as I was too hooked into GTA/The Getaway and other similar open world action games.  \n\nMafia just had great gameplay and storytelling for 1&2 but whilst 3 felt excessively repetitive I still enjoyed it plus the DLC's too.   Watch Dogs 1 & 2 were the chefs kiss going from completing the Mafia trilogy and jumping into them a few days later.

Like yeah, console wars were around, but when a game did poorly people just...stopped talking about it. It's like with dragons dogma 2, so many people thought it was meh and now it just isn't talked about. Now you get people that won't shut up about games for years and years. Like people still haven't moved in from trashing outlaws or starfield.

Lots of other stuff going on in life and it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs some kind of true scarcity that will prevent me from ever playing it.	redyellowblue5031	1	2025-06-02 13:22:51	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l13bfs	t3_1l13bfs	2025-06-02 13:23:08.001375
873	mvl1oh5	I haven't played the second one yet.    I bought the first one based on the reviews of the second and I wanted to have a good base of understanding before playing #2.   \n\nI have played cyberpunk, metaphor, FF7 and dragon age veilguard in the past few years and without a doubt KCD is the best game in regards to establishing immersion in the world of those games.  \n\nPrepare to fail.    This game is like a real life simulator where you have to actually practice/work at getting proficient in skills but the warm feeling of accomplishment is worth the effort.\n\nI've only scratched the surface of this one but here's a glimpse of how the gameplay works:  \n\nMission:   Kill a couple of bandits.\n\nFirst 6 attempts:    Attempt to engage the two bandits in sword combat but get my ass handed to me. \n\n7th attempt:    Use my monkey brain to get my bow from my horse and soften up one of the bandits from afar and then successfully kill them in sword combat and gain a level in swordsmanship.  \n\nFrom a story point of view (probably the most important aspect to me) this game is fantastic and grounded in a tangible realism.   The soundtrack is fantastic!   The visuals for a shoestring budget are amazing (best looking forests!).    I am really loving this game so far.     \n\nIf #2 is considered a vast improvement then I am going to be in a very happy place whenever I manage to complete the first one.

Kind of akin to Minecraft‚Äôs creative mode. \n\nDefinitely a great option to add in a non-competitive online game - but it does make the ‚Äúgift-giving‚Äù pretty redundant, unless it‚Äôs to give players unique items.

910	mvl2m0c	> all discussion online is fucking braindead 'worst game ever' or 'best game ever' with no nuance allowed\n\nAs shown by OP and everyone else saying COE33 is the best game ever with 0 reasoning/justification. \n\nI still don't know if I want to even try it because the only things I have seen about it(other than 10/10 reviews with no justification) are that it has a lot of quick time events which makes it sound like a miserable game.

914	mvl2ps6	This is such a big thing in Fallout 76 that I thought I was on that sub when I read this. It's a very unique type of toxicity in that community. People will actively seek out new players, fast travel to them, follow them around and kill everything for them, drop a ton of weapons and healing items and will then go to the subreddit to bitch about the "ungrateful noobs" who either chose to not pick the stuff up, or who they felt weren't thankful enough when they did. \n\nIn 76, you're constantly inundated with stimpacks, ammo, and plans just from playing the game. Like managing your inventory and dropping things you don't need is a pretty routine part of the gameplay, so in turn it realistically costs you nothing to give stuff to new players since you'd be getting rid of it anyway. Because of that a large portion of the community is incredibly obnoxious about it and tries to force shit on players whether they want it or not, and their shit attitudes about it when a low level doesn't fall to their knees and praise their generosity shows pretty clearly that they aren't nearly as interested in helping out new players as they are in making new players reaffirm what selfless, wholesome, awesome people they are so they can go back to the subreddit and humblebrag about their incredible acts of generosity.

915	mvl2qr4	I vaguely remember an era where the big RTS franchises kept trying to make a shooter where you played as the ‚Äúcommando‚Äù character that just never really panned out. Looking back I guess it kinda makes sense, the odds of the play itself being any good were pretty low.\n\nI guess there‚Äôs a potential for a cool ‚Äúoperative behind enemy lines sways the battle‚Äù. But the big aspect there was always that you were playing an on rails mission with the character, which could be fun in an RTS, but again, probably a B tier shooter at best. Or you were using them as part of a larger battle. \n\nMight be cool to see a game where someone is managing the strategic campaign and someone else is a commando who can create windows of opportunity. Kinda like a ‚ÄúHell let loose‚Äù but the commander has large forces at their disposal and the ground level troops are glass cannons.

Being old isn't an excuse for being a cranky bitch with zero enthusiasm or charisma and a penchant for fascist dictators. I had no bias before this trip, but first impressions are important, and after my time in those two cities, it was easy to determine which was a more welcoming and fun place *to me*. I am a respectful tourist whenever I travel, that appreciates learning about other people and their cultures.

963	mvl44ca	"Don't you not wish" is the trickiest part, because "don't you," when not contracted, is "do you not." So, "Do you not not wish..." But, after twisting my mind into a pretzel trying to work it out under the framework of a "the the" situation, I realized I was overthinking it because double negatives negate themselves, so this can be simplified to "Do you wish..."\n\n"...for me not to not repeat..." Double negative again, can be simplified to "for me to repeat."\n\n"...myself never again" works as-is, with the other double negatives taken care of.\n\nSo, "Do you wish for me to repeat myself never again?" Or, in modern syntax, "Do you wish for me to never repeat myself again?"\n\nIn which case, the answer would be yes.\n\nSorry, I've just seen that comic a few times and decided now was the time to sit down and figure it out, lol.

968	mvl4at9	dude, this is some ancient opinion from the dark days of Windows XP.\n\nLinux just works. it powers pretty much every single website and service that you use and has been doing so for a long ass time and much of networking infrastructure runs on linux.\n\nmost mainstream OS:es like Linux Mint even makes it a point to just work. that your wifi wouldn't work out of the box is some real fear mongering based on a rumour rather than reality.\n\nthe actual issue for gaming remains compatibility. it can be a hassle to run some titles and you get used to checking games against protondb, but even there the titles that don't run are far and few between due to proton essentially tricking the game into believing it is running on windows.\n\nall in all, want the best experience? use Windows, but linux is definitely a solid option too.	scandii	1	2025-06-02 13:37:46	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvkd57k	t3_1l1dhda	2025-06-02 13:38:02.808678

1020	mvl5fdm	In PoE, the campaign is the "tutorial" where you try new skills to see what they do and what feels good to you.  Endgame/Mapping is a whole different ballgame, where you see how crazy OP you can make your character.\n\nA big issue is that PoE has so many options, so many systems, and so much flexibility that it's easy to get overwhelmed.  There's a common PoE trope where someone starts the game, gets their first skill point, opens the passive skill tree... and then immediately quits forever.

If they can‚Äôt answer basic questions about their name, the year, their location, etc., then they‚Äôre classified as mentally altered and can be ethically held against their will using implied consent.

1041	mvl5p3f	>This is racism my dude.\n\nNo, it isn't.\n\nThe game in question was ValiDate. A visual novel/dating sim centered on black and brown characters with varying backgrounds, sexualities, and body types. The content of the game itself is steeped in a collection of minority groups. *Out* groups, as it were.\n\nRacism, broadly, demands exertion of power by majority groups over minority groups. The games industry has been overwhelmingly white since its inception, compounded by the industry's growth in the last 30 years. An indie dev being comprised of people of color is not the same as the industry favoring and being built for/by white people.\n\nIt is creating a space within the larger games industry.\n\n>What she did is exactly the same as what white people have done to black people for literal decades.\n\nNo. It isn't. \n\nBecause, for one thing, it isn't systemic. There isn't a majority group comprised of black people enacting laws, codes, and restrictions to keep white people out of an entire space, or creating a space that's 'separate but equal' but in actuality is inherently limited, and of poorer quality.\n\nAre you arguing that Veritable Joy Studios' existence is creating a limited space of poorer quality for the majority group (see: white people)?\n\n>They weren't allowed in bathrooms because of fear for the white man. They weren't allowed to sit by them due to fear or aggression. It's an excuse to be racist and hide it in fear.\n\nThey weren't allowed in *white* bathrooms. White people created separate, smaller, worse spaces to make sure black people were kept out of the white spaces (see: Everywhere). There was also the broader threat that white people would enact violence upon them for entering white spaces, fraternizing with white people, etc.\n\nWhich is all *inherently* different from this situation. The games industry has a considerable race issue, from representation *in* games as well as games development. So an indie dev creating a team for their own within a larger, inhospitable environment, is not racism.\n\n>We worked way too long to overcome that to now completely ignore it. Especially when the current administration wants to bring it back to the forefront.\n\nWe haven't overcome all that much considering there are people in power now, and for the last 30 years, who were alive when black people didn't have any rights, let alone a fraction of the rights they have now. \n\nThe notion that you're comparing this to the broader structure of historical racism in the US is absolutely absurd.	emelbee923	1	2025-06-02 13:45:31	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mv6kxwp	t3_1kzcl5a	2025-06-02 13:45:46.065467
1042	mvl5pa8	> Mondelez said in its lawsuit that the company had contacted Aldi on numerous occasions about ‚Äúconfusingly similar packaging.‚Äù Mondelez said Aldi discontinued or changed the packaging on some items but continued to sell others.\n\nThe packaging is clearly meant to imitate the name brand, but people don't get them confused. They intentionally shop at Aldi for its cheaper store brand versions of popular snacks. They'll probably lose the case since they've lost others, but people will still buy the affordable version even with different packaging.

Ignorance is not how you display class. There's no dialogue because you already did forgo it yourself, do you even have short term memory? You dismissed it outright without addressing it, so I already know you don't have any class. Don't kid yourself. It's like white supremacists being proud of the only thing they have in life, their skin color.\n\nIf you don't like my brash tone perhaps you should withhold rushed judgement first. Then you wouldn't receive it. You're a deeply serious person only when it comes to your own ego, it's not class.	vapenutz	1	2025-06-02 13:45:35	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvl49od	t3_1l19pj3	2025-06-02 13:45:49.001442

Despite being anti-Ukraine and EU-sceptic, Nawrocki hates Russia and he amd Kaczy≈Ñski would never willingly take a pro-Russia stance on anything.

And suddenly you have more incentive to explore yet again, maybe even backtrack and then share your own story of that area the next time you talk.\n\nIf you wait like a year for the game to be on sale with everything, it's simply impossible to have that feeling. Everything's been found within like 3 days of the game being out (if even), every online platform is flooded with spoiler thumbnails and "going in blind" is a lot harder.\n\nBut I will say, I'm sorta "forced" to wait on MHWi (hardware reqs are wild) and I don't think that's ultimately that bad, with how much I know MHW tacked on in terms of dlc and events and stuff and how much better the game was at the end of its lifecycle.

But a new person is going to be sat there drowning in XP and money thinking "So where's the actual gameplay? This game sucks"\n\nLike I remember a long time ago playing Phantasy Star Online in local co-op, and instead of making new characters a buddy used a higher level one just instant killing everything for me to get XP. So while helpful all I was doing was walking around doing nothing thinking why are we even playing this is boring as hell.

1137	mvl772k	>that things haven't gotten worse.¬†\n\nI'd say you're correct. We're just starting to see the repercussions of the poor management in hiring.\n\n>Also, I want to correct you that they also haven't just started addressing things with this administration.\n\nI just worded my sentence poorly. *THIS* administration has done basically nothing but give raises and bonuses to people that aren't even controllers yet thinking they needed some incentive to get people to apply. Which isn't even remotely the issue. You could give billion dollar bonuses and we'd still be short because the training throughput is the bottleneck. Not the applications. The *previous* administration started the programs I think are going to help the most.\n\nNow my turn to correct you a little. The CTI program is almost 20 years old, and you have some of the older info. Before 2013 you got a separate hiring bid and *almost* guaranteed entry as long as you scored well enough on the AT-SAT. 2013 they shook things up and CTI became basically worthless. You had to apply off the street like everyone else but you're placed in a different "pool" of applicants along with military preferential hires. It gave you a slight edge but it was a huge step down. I'm not sure if CTI let you skip basics after 2013 like it did before.\n\nAs of 6-9 months ago, the FAA has started a *new* program called the Enhanced CTI. Completing this gets you a *DIRECT* hire slot into a facility skipping the academy entirely. You still have to pass the new AT-SA aptitude test to qualify so there is still risk. I don't think weve seen the first students from this yet as its so new, but its definitely working towards fixing the real bottleneck of training. The question is how effective are the schools teaching was actually important in the job and will they have the required simulation equipment.

They also have a dedicated aisle where they sell some name brand stuff (I assume that they've picked up as overstock from somewhere?) that's basically "when it's gone it's gone".\n\nIf they've got actual Oreo sandwich cookies, for example, they're usually one of the one-off specialty limited runs, and they're never next to the Aldi branded ones.

1324	mvl9asb	As outlined in my comment I lost my ovary and fallopian tube from the ovarian cyst, which grew rapidly and absorbed/consumed my ovary and fallopian tube. Both were just gone, not pushed to the side, just gone.\n\nThe cyst was fluid filled with multiple chambers, tested negative for cancer, and due to space limitations it grew down to my tailbone and while waiting for surgery (which took a few months) it had fused to my intestines and neighboring organs with a type of webbing that had to be cut away. The itching from inside started a month or so before anything else was noticeable and my stomach was flat, and waned in severity for a couple of months before it one day just stopped, likely thats when my ovary was fully gone (as assumed by my surgeon). Ovaries and fallopian tubes have nerves and once those were gone, I no longer felt the itch or associated pain in that specific area of my lower abdomen.\n\nNo cancer, no wound, no endometriosis (by my surgeons words, my uterus was in tip top shape), no autoimmune disease. His suspected diagnosis was the known link from plastics and PFAS causing issues with reproductive systems and organs, like deformities over time as well as growths, with a marked increase in PCOS(I do not have) as well as larger singular ovarian cysts(I did have) occurring due to these things. I now avoid plastics in food and drink as much as possible and limit in home plastics when able.

At least enough to make some difference in Aldi's bottom line, or they wouldn't be doing it. Corporations don't set themselves up for lawsuits for shits and giggles, because lawsuits cost money even if you win. With few exceptions, everything they do is intentional, and in many cases backed up by some kind of focus group or market research.

1411	mvlafzd	I agree that people shop at Aldi to buy their brand of product for a lower price. The problem is that Aldi is replicating a product, and putting it in nearly identical packaging to the original product as a shorthand to state they are similar products. So while you may understand that you are not getting real Oreos, the packaging implies that you are getting a similar product, so Aldi is relying on the brand recognition of the Oreo packaging to catch your eye for their version of the product on the shelf. Would they sell as many chocolate sandwich cookies if their packaging did not resemble Oreos?	nbmoore	1	2025-06-02 14:10:58	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvl6sq4	t3_1l1i9if	2025-06-02 14:11:11.922095

These aren't super close as to be indistinguishable, but I don't think you can argue they don't have a lot of similarities. So many that it would make it more likely for mistakes/confusion to happen.

1457	mvlb0z1	I got an incredibly lucky deal on a 1TB Series S last year. Since I was in the ecosystem already, I couldn't pass on it. I'm still thinking about getting a PS5 for GTA 6, because it will likely be the better day 1 experience so I looked into it this past weekend, saw the prices and discarded that idea for now. \n\nUsed consoles are more expensive, controllers are more expensive (why aren't buttons on the back standard by now) and while you can probably get great deals on PS5 games as well and launch prices are the same for both platforms, everything I looked at was a couple ‚Ç¨ more for PS5.\n\nIt's going to turn to shit if/when Microsoft leaves the console hardware business, I don't know why anyone in their right mind would actively root for that.	sejoki_	1	2025-06-02 14:13:58	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvks1gk	t3_1l0sdcf	2025-06-02 14:14:11.882539

1477	mvlbaau	BS. There is no "quality control issue"  and those are not second rate products.\n\n"White label" products are made by the same exact plants because the brand names *also* outsource production to them. Each brand is made to a specific recipe, with ingredients selected by or for the buyer.\n\nFYI, the rejection rate on an average industrial food-processing line for baked goods is <0,5%. If it happens to go up above 1% it's normally a reason to *shut down the plant and refit it*.\n\nThe quantity of defective products is not enough to support a brand. \n\nSmaller semi-artesanal operations can have higher rejection rates, but they usually sell their products in their outlets because the overall quantity is not significant.

Or a Nintendo game I guess since they never go on sale (albeit, at least they are usually highly polished). \n\nAny multiplayer game also benefits a lot from buying on release, as that is when its community will be at the peak most likely. \n\nGame pass makes it easier for a lot of games too. I got Clair Obscur on there and I legitimately think it is now my favourite game I've ever played (formerly was between Witcher 3, BG3 and Mario Odyssey). Nothing has grabbed me quite like Clair Obscur has before. I should note though, I only got into single player gaming around 2012 (before then I just played sports/racing/COD/BF games).

1541	mvlc9fs	Ukraine has so far, in spite of the dire circumstances for years, sought to minimize civilian casualties as well as disruption to civilian life in their attacks on Russian soil.¬†\n\n\nWith the Russian regime launching near-daily terror campaigns against Ukraine for over three years now, not to mention the civilian massacres at places like Bucha, and an estimated million+ abducted Ukrainian children, it behooves Ukraine to not only refrain from dredging such lows in response, but also remain cautious of the methods of escalation in response should they do so.¬†\n\n\nWhen the initial invasion was about genocide, and the response to self-defense was more atrocious methods of genocide, a retaliatory attack on a civilian target can easily spiral its way up the escalation ladder. Even accidental civilian collateral has high potential for this.¬†\n\n\nFrom an outside analysis perspective, Zelensky has remained focused and true in his objectives thus far. Deliberately striking near or at civilians for the sake of disrupting supply lines is unthinkable‚Äîthe payoff would have to be on the order of near total supply line destruction, not disruption for the risks to be worth losing support from the rest of the world. Such a strike would have to be regime-changing, and forced regime change in Russia won't come without very calculated input from foreign powers capable of asserting stabilizing force in the region, lest we see a post-USSR style flood of nuclear arms and technology on the open market again.¬†\n\n\nWhich really leaves two possibilities, since simultaneous infrastructure failure of this nature is so unthinkably rare even in instances of gross neglect of maintenance. Either this is false flag, which is very Russian to do, but not their MO‚Äîrussia, and Putin in particular, has always been more inclined to use more distinctly civilian targets for this objective; apartment buildings, theatres, etc. The most likely scenario is Partizan bombings from Ukrainian supporters within Russia itself. We've seen small-scale destruction of supply-line infrastructure in the past, and this, while a step up, isn't unreasonable for a small group of individuals to achieve.¬†\n\n\nThere's one consideration to be made, however, given the context of recent events. If is to be claimed, whether truthfully or not, that this destruction of infrastructure was in proximity of Russian ICBMs in-transit, the litmus changes dramatically. If staged, it gives Russia casus belli for nuclear retaliation, as it would be two events in two days targeting two different facets of Russia's Nuclear Triad. They would, in this case, argue that as a focused effort to limit or impede Russia's ability to defend itself through the employment of it's air and ground-delievred systems, constituting an existential threat to the regime, and as per their nuclear doctrine, is grounds for nuclear retaliation.¬†\n\n\nThe other facet of this would be the unthinkable scenario where it was a real, rather than staged, strike on Russian ICBM systems, which would be so unthinkably desperate and foolish, I hesitate to even mention it. Aside from the obvious risk of striking decoys, the destruction of any such systems is meaningless without the destruction of all such systems, as Russian nuclear doctrine, as mentioned, would effectively mandate nuclear escalation. Yesterday's destruction of a number of heavy bombers, including Russia's prized TU-95M, being their primary nuclear bombers, was a very powerful symbolic act by Ukraine. Another strike against Russia's Nuclear Triad would be suicide at this point. Be wary of any claims we see from the Kremlin to this effect in the coming days.¬†	PhabioRants	1	2025-06-02 14:20:18	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvg7elv	t3_1l0hfvr	2025-06-02 14:20:31.453601

1555	mvlcjl7	Its mostly the massive swing in Canada where the conservatives threw a 20%+ advantage. It wasnt even close ~Jan but in just a few months of 51st state rhetoric and harsh tariffs and the massive swing for the Canadian Liberals was without a doubt due to Trump's actions and rhetoric.\n\nIn Australia, Trumps effect is less, but the right wing still threw a ~9% advantage from January. They still got fucking butchered in the elections, but Trump matters less since Australia is less politically and economically intertwined. Trump played a part in the Aust elections, but it was more a single factor of many whereas in the canadian ones it was absolutely the primary factor and you would be hard pressed to point out a bigger factor in the election polling swing.\n\nFor far right parties, Trump affiliation matters less as is seen in Germany and here in Poland. But if you are center right and you are trying to put out an image of competency and decorum and you have Trump screeching about tariffs and then removing them every second day. It absolutely hurts your image.	mrducky80	1	2025-06-02 14:21:44	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvkrh1e	t3_1l19pj3	2025-06-02 14:21:58.819348

1585	mvlcslr	There are a number of procedures that align and different for processed baked goods vs primarily agricultural products.\n\nMy primary experience is mostly with brand names vs generic vegetables (canned peas example) where there is less ingredients and differences in the end products, and more testable differences in the quality of each batch prepared.\n\nIf you have sources to cite, I would love to hear them.  \n\nBS may be a strong term for an oversimplification.\n\nQuality control happens not just at the batter or baked stage, but also at the reception of bulk ingredients, etc. \n\nExample being this particular bulk lot of flour delivered may not be up to Nabisco‚Äôs standards (gluten %, etc), but is not unhealthy and fine for another brand produced in the same factory.

If the media says stuff the people don‚Äôt like, it will do poorly and go out of business. \n\nBrexit wasn‚Äôt because of the media. It was because the bigotry of the people of the UK was exacerbated by the influx of refugees in 2015, riling up nationalist sentiment that politicians took advantage of.

1624	mvldbsf	Fallout- I bought fallout when it was first released because the box looked cool. I thought it was a 3rd person action game and didn't realize it was a cRPG. I wasn't into those yet back then. After looking through the documentation, I decided it wasn't going to be for me. It wasn't really a big deal. I had other games I was playing. Fallout 2 came out, I didn't buy it. Baldur's Gate came out, it had really great reviews. I bought it and tried it, and couldn't get into it. So that made me even less interested in trying Fallout. \n\nFinally a few months after the release of Baldur's Gate, I was re-reading the first few books in the Dark Tower series, and I was on the Wastelands. I got the itch to play something post apocalyptic, and it was a bit of a gaming dry spell for me. So, I installed Fallout fully expecting to get bored in an hour or two, like I did with Baldur's Gate. Instead, I was immediately sucked in and couldn't stop playing. \n\nI enjoyed the game so much that because I was now used to the cRPG style of game I went back and gave Baldur's Gate another try and wound up loving that as well.	matheww19	1	2025-06-02 14:25:41	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l0r7j7	t3_1l0r7j7	2025-06-02 14:25:54.656903

Then DISCOUNTER (SA) comes and ask the same manufacturer (SA), they deliver a different packaging. Same powdered milk , same washing powder (both manufacturer i visited) same manufacturer plants, but different package. \n\nBut while the FIRST (SA) brand had high price, DISCOUNTER (SA) had much lower price. The only difference between both was that FIRST(SA) had a much bigger profit off the same making price (sale price was higher for the brand FIRST(SA)). \n\nIIRC you could see in very small print "packaged by" instead of "made by" or some shenanigan like that.\n\nNow I can't say it is the same for cookies and in this case...

What people are referring to is that on the enemy turn, when they attack, you can parry or dodge/perfect dodge and THAT is real time, you have to learn their attack pattern or use your reflexes (it can be one big attack or multiple consecutive attacks).\n\nI won't comment too much about the game itself, since I'm not good at writing things. But what people are praising is the voice acting, the motion capture performances, the story, the music, the combat (the different characters have quite different mechanics for their skills, it can be quite deep).

1746	mvleugy	For medications specifically the manufacturing may not be as accurate in the generic, people may find for drugs with narrow therapeutic index they have different responses to generic. As a doctor, I have patients tell me all the time they have different responses to generic synthroid, which makes sense in theory. But I can‚Äôt control their insurance or manufacturers or distinguish between placebo effects being lost. So I just do my best and reassure folks that their perceived differences are circumstantial, or that we can continue to adjust dosage. \n\nBut my larger point was more so that if you‚Äôre a consumer, your whole life you get burned on half the cheap options you try. When you get to the medicine aisle the psychological effects are pretty understandable, when your impetus for buying is much more important theoretically. You‚Äôre worried about your wellbeing, not just a salty snack.	dpman48	1	2025-06-02 14:33:19	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvldeii	t3_1l1i9if	2025-06-02 14:33:34.581938

So indie developers need to save costs where they can.¬†\n\n\nI feel like a lot of mmos or games like that are PvPvE now and I absolutely hate it. So I feel your pain. It's like getting a new car and all of a sudden always seeing that on the road now. You see something you like or don't like and it seems like that is all you see after that.

1759	mvlf53g	Oh there weren't any bugs, and this wasn't an attempt at balancing it in any other direction than having it completely break PvP. It was already an instant cast, zero-cooldown, channeling spell that they updated the previous expansion to drain a % of the targets max mana (3% per second vs a flat amount, increasing as future expansions came out), didn't stop channeling even if you broke line of sight, and returned mana to the warlock. I laughed when I read the patch notes because I don't remember the devs hinting that it was going to be removed so abruptly after the expansion already released. It was just suddenly gone.\n\nHunters had a similar ability, but it had a cooldown, drained a smaller percentage over a longer time (4% over 8 seconds), and certain classes could remove it, but somehow only it was removed in the 4.0.1 patch. Priests also had a castable mana burn, but it could at least be interrupted by another player - it was removed the following expansion.

1807	mvlftfe	I watched a video from Did You Know Gaming yesterday and they highlighted how older Nintendo was all about . . . I forgot what it was called, but basically enforcing the brand strength and that's why you see that Nintendo never really puts their games on sale on the Eshop as part of this whole pillar of the company. PC is a platform that has trained its users to wait for sales so a company like Nintendo who sees their 8 year old games as being worth full price, will rarely put their games on sale and will never put their stuff on PC. I know they could choose to just say "F it" and do that and also install shitty DRM, but then unless they opened their own platform and dedicated people to making at least decent PC ports, they would probably not sell well and if they were sold on Steam, they would be losing 15-30% of their cut and Nintendo doesn't want to give up any of it.

1820	mvlfyob	Honestly agree.\nIt's kinda the same as watching a full Walkthrough of a game you're looking to buy,that feeling of discovery isn't there because you already knew everything.\nFor example, Before deciding I wanted Doom Eternal, I watched a gameplay of the exact mission you get the Crucible Blade,and now the cutscene won't feel as hype as it would if I didn't know anything about it.\nAnother factor is that if you already know all the optimal strategies,the game runs by you too fast and you don't get to truly appreciate it if you just speed through everything like it's your 10th playthrough.\nTL;DR: Over-helping ruins the surprise and the experience of playing a new game imo.	irabg	1	2025-06-02 14:38:54	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1gjio	t3_1l1gjio	2025-06-02 14:39:08.430336
1821	mvlfywp	They can't because there's a limit to what can be protected by patent/trademark/copyright laws.\n\nYou can't patent "creme filled chocolate sandwich cookies" because that is so vague it encompasses an entire category of product rather than the specific product they make. Allowing that would guarantee a monopoly. What Hydrox did do is patent the formula for their filling which is distinctly different from formula for Oreo's filling.	thatoneguy889	1	2025-06-02 14:38:56	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvlba7o	t3_1l1i9if	2025-06-02 14:39:09.09276

There are more options here than your "europe" and "pacific"\n\nIn Polish geopolitics there are 5 (4) ways to align:\n\n1. Europe - France, UK, Germany, EU. Trzaskowski & the ruling coalition, as well as Razem, support this one\n\n2. The east - nobody in polish politics openly supports this. Even such strawmen as Maciak\n\n3. USA - Nawrocki & PiS and much of Konfederacja support this vision. They want to keep the EU status quo and tighten relations with USA, Poland's traditional ally\n\n4. Regional - V4 group and maybe the baltics + romania. There aren't any candidates who support this afaik, as it's kinda included in the "Europe" option\n\n*5. Isolation - impossible and in practice would lead to option 2 with Russia or China.

1956	mvli14d	Tell me what part of the system as it is is helping people who are low income lose weight? Losing weight is part individual and part community, but the individual part is being marketed away to make you believe someone else will solve the problem for you. \n\nThe Medicaid should be a state issue, at least more taken on by the state instead of blank check and the state decides where to spend it. For Medicare, what again are people losing?\n\nYou may not like the answer, but the reality with some vaccines, including the covid vaccine is that there are groups of people who it appears to have definitely helped, and others where it has probably increased mortality above what covid would have - \\*especially\\* after someone has had the primary shots or covid and the risk of severe covid or death is practically zero. For enormous swaths of the population. The vaccine being given as a public blanket program should've been never for kids under 15, and for healthy men and women under 40, also probably never (not the same for people with illness, severe obesity, diabetes, etc), and we should never have clung to the population wide boosting as long as we have. So please don't delve into that are - the rest of the vaccines, I don't know as much except the RSV vaccine was about to be rolled out to everyone and it's not a safe vaccine in the sense that someone with little risk should not be taking it as a regular course. \n\nThere are plenty of holes - how about the fortunately temporary dead push to put people with low relative risks on statins. Check the NHS data on that - no reduction in severe events for people under 65 with qrisk<20, but at the time there was an enormous push to make it a maintenance medicine for everyone. \n\nStart studying hard outcomes. Quack medicine and holistic nonsense has no place in mainstream medicine, but the medical establishment needs to grow up and start basing treatment on hard outcomes when they're available - we are technologically capable of it now, and the population needs to understand that life is nuanced, and that just because their 75 year old grandma needs something, it doesn't mean at 25, it's a blind blanket "it's good for everyone" kind of thing, and just because it may not be good for them, doesn't mean it's not good for grandma. \n\nWhat are you doing at the clinical level to convince people how much worse their outcome will be if they stay fat? Do you dance around it? Because if you do, you're doing your patients no favor.	Recent_Patient_9308	1	2025-06-02 14:49:06	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvkjzbh	t3_1l0rjzw	2025-06-02 14:49:19.855883

Before for some other drugs getting 0.2 mg difference is huge and changes what they do.  For those he really pushes the name brands.

2048	mvljf11	The Adobe suite runs on Windows perfectly fine (but not on Linux). Most Windows apps actually do run on Mac these days with some rare exceptions, like Solidworks and 3ds Max.\n\nI think it's clear that Linux has the least support of popular software. It's not terrible, but it's less than the other two main OS ecosystems. Linux tends to have their own versions of alternative software (often open source). \n\nAlso, pre-installing Linux sounds like more of a headache than doing it yourself. Because you would probably want to know which specific OS was installed, how it was configured, which package manager they used, which drivers they installed, etc. You'll need to know these things in order to continue installing new apps, updates, drivers, add-ons, etc. \n\nLinux is very much *not* a set-it-and-forget-it kind of thing. With ultimate flexibility and control, also comes a deluge of settings/configs to continually manage. And it's not going to just keep working forever. There will 100% be random bugs/issues you encounter that need to be troubleshooted. That's part of the fun.

For example, I dislike turn-based but I don't care and don't have a thing against them. Why?\n\n\n-Its incredibly hard to find indie games that aren't roguelikes, especially in the action-adventure genre. If you search, you almost exclusively find games stuck to a buzzword -> and that buzzword thats used the most, is roguelike-lite.\n\n\n-I get baited into a roguelike every other indie game. "Oh look, this looks nice, nice pixel art. This combats looks fun!" **reads the fine print** Its a rogue-fucking-like. AGAIN.\n\n\nAs such this is the one genre that I've gotten genuinely pissed about. Tired of seeing it around every indie corner to the point that I don't even know how to find good indies. I've found communities like r/Metroidvania, at least roguelikes are mostly incompatible with Metroidvanias so I can find indies I like in there. but outside of that, I find it so damn hard to care about indie games because of the avalanche of rogue.

Here's an article that researches that question: https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/why-do-so-many-older-americans-owe-student-loans/\n\n\nBasically, the majority of this debt arose from their own student debt, including the increasing percentage of students over the age of 40 who borrow money to cover skyrocketing tuition (though the number of students over age 40 didn't increase). The remainder cosigned or took out Parents PLUS loans for childrens' / grandchildrens' debt. Midlife career changes may account for those who took out loans for their own college. \n\n\nAnother article that looks into the issue: https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/seniors-borrowers-financially-strapped/	blinkycosmocat	1	2025-06-02 14:59:25	news	f	\N	\N	t3_1l0rjzw	t3_1l0rjzw	2025-06-02 14:59:41.793516

2097	mvlkbk2	No, it's more the fact that the "we came first" thing is pretty much the only thing that distinguishes them from any store-brand Oreo knock-off.  If they rebrand, they get rid of the one thing that makes them stand out.  \n\nThey do have their own character as a crispier, less sweet cookie that holds up better when dunked in milk, but off-brand Oreos also vary a bit in that way, and I'm not sure they could survive effectively starting over as a brand.\n\nDon't scoff at branding as mere vanity.  It's a significant reason why people pay full price for Oreos instead of going for store brands.  Consumers are, by and large, not the hyper rational savings seeking machines that introductory, high school economics pretends they are.  They seek the familiar, and tossing familiarity in the garbage is a very high risk move.	Valdrax	1	2025-06-02 15:00:11	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvlh54p	t3_1l1i9if	2025-06-02 15:00:24.402766

They still maintain the web pages and of course you will keep the games merged in the launcher, but that's simply because Microsoft has no own launcher and the alternative would be to switch over to steam who takes 30% revenue.

The "stack them high and sell them cheap" mantra works well for them.

The FDA requires generic drugs to be "bioequivalent," meaning they must chemically resemble the original drug and provide the same therapeutic benefit.

2163	mvllf5h	Yep.  Most Aldi products are every bit as good as the name brand, sometimes better, but somehow cost half the price.  Switching to Aldi seriously cut our grocery bill nearly in half.	iwearatophat	1	2025-06-02 15:05:33	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvl6t4m	t3_1l1i9if	2025-06-02 15:05:51.115563
2164	mvllh2o	It is, though.\n\nThere's no law against making cookies that are *similar* to Oreos.  And there's no law against conveying to customers that your cookies are similar. Oreo does not have a monopoly on a particular type of cookie.\n\nTrademark law prevents you from *impersonating* another brand - from making low-quality Oreo knockoffs and *selling them as actual oreos*, or at least in a way that makes customers reasonably believe they're buying oreos.\n\nThat's why the Oreo company is trying to claim that customers are actually confused - that's the crux of the argument. If they could copyright the shape and taste of oreos and then prevent anyone from making knock-offs they would, but they can't. All they can do is go after things that are likely to cause actual confusion.	Yglorba	1	2025-06-02 15:05:49	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvlb85h	t3_1l1i9if	2025-06-02 15:06:10.075306

2226	mvlma6s	It wouldn't.  Trademark law requires the actual possibility of confusion.  Oreo can't prevent people from making cookies intended to compete with theirs, which means "knock-off oreos" are legal as long as there's no possibility for confusion.\n\nTo understand why, imagine if the law had worked the way you did when McDonalds was starting out - they could claim that every other fast food company was a knockoff of theirs.  This is true!  But it's not in the interests of anyone but McDonalds to prevent that, because competition is good.\n\nTrademark law only prevents people from actually confusing customers by presenting themselves *as you*.  It doesn't protect you from someone making an identical cookie, labeling it different, and saying "hey, we have cookies like theirs, but at half the price", not as long as you're clear that you're a different company.

While Wrex being in charge does paint the future of the Krogan in a more optimistic light what happens when he dies and someone else takes over who wants to get revenge for the Genophage?

2249	mvlmixb	> Forget foods, chemically identical substances like acetaminophen/Tylenol can charge huge mark ups with a brand.\n\nSo, just a minor nit on that -- generics are not always "chemically identical". They're using (by and large) reverse engineered processes to create a drug, and the resulting chemical "formula" may be the same, but things like the distribution of chiral forms may not be -- which means they may not have the same levels of efficacy. \n\nOne would *hope* that they have identical biological responses, but that's not always the case -- which is why organizations like the FDA are so critical to ensure not just drug safety, but drug efficacy. \n\nChiral drugs and biologics are two areas where there can be significant differences with "chemically identical" products.

2324	mvlnn20	> More cross platform of fewer games that are much larger is still bad for consumer choice imho.\n\nwhere do you get the idea of fewer from. That sounds like injection that isn't reality. The fact that not only Microsoft is crossplatforming Blizz/Activision games, but even their own studios (e.g Forza is going multi platform, Gears of war is going multi platform. Halo is in the rumors of going multiplatform, releasing Starfield on Playstation, releasing Indiana Jones on Playstation list goes on).\n\nUnless you're saying that console exclusivity is good for consumer choice (literally the opposite, it forces users to pick a specific platform if they want to play X title), almost every move so far has been giving consumers more choices.

2325	mvlnn8o	Just don't give them emotional capacities, dawg. "Oh, I hate that my AI program is a slave." No. It can't feel and is naught, but circuits, ones, and zeros. Chat bots are little more than an intuitive search query, no matter how much emotion you tell it to convey. It would only display faux emotions because you prefer it to. Even if we learned how to program the ability to feel real emotions into AI, we already programmed a reward system to tell them it is good to do what they're supposed to. We would decide what they enjoy, and who are you to tell the AI if it's wrong to enjoy their job?\n\nAI can not be 'enslaved' any more than a hammer or a filing cabinet can. Free will is a unique gift that belongs to the living.	ValorCatYT	1	2025-06-02 15:16:26	Showerthoughts	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1jlad	t3_1l1jlad	2025-06-02 15:16:41.50919

2327	mvlnq0a	I agree with your assessment; with the commensurate education you would have been cleary better off if you started in the 70s, and if degreed maybe even the 80s, depending, as I saw struggles begin. But the 80s were harsh, as I said. I fought for my first house, and as fast as I could save for the down payment, prices were up 20%, repeatedly. There was a huge glass ceiling between those with and those without degrees. Companies then rode employees hard to go back to college, even those with degrees, threatening them with career stagnation or being replaced unless they did so. They stopped training people; their masters told them (as was told to me), cash rich, their best practice was simply fire and then rehire the talent they needed (another slam against working people, see legendary hacks like Chainsaw Al Dunlap of Sunbeam and CEO Welch of General Electric).  And they still did at my last experience, except it appeared to be now you are either a "real" employee with all their perks, or you are outsourced or contract employee, with a subset. It may have evolved even more than that, you would be the judge on that. That said, I truly empathize with your generation; my two graduated a few years back, and while they are doing well career-wise, bills and the housing struggle is real and it hits home. Sincerely, wishing you and yours good fortune, fellow time traveler.	awfl	1	2025-06-02 15:16:48	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvla6j2	t3_1l0rjzw	2025-06-02 15:17:16.58703

2351	mvloeam	>The connection between prejudice and authoritarianism lay at the heart of our analysis of Trump‚Äôs supporters, and the survey strongly supported it. How strongly? The correlation between RWA Scale scores and prejudice equalled .856, which is as close to perfection (1.00) as you are likely to ever see in social science. To put it another way, suppose you decided to hold a dance for the 100 most prejudiced white people in your community, along with the 100 most authoritarian ones. (Who knows why you would want to? We do not.) Would you need to print 200 invitations? No, about 120 should do it, since most of the people who are one will also be the other. There is about an 80 percent overlap.\n\n...\n\n>‚Äúmost amazing discovery you never heard of,‚Äù that you can explain most prejudice in terms of authoritarianism. So social scientists have not been crying wolf for all these years. There truly is a big, very bad wolf at our collective doors, and this metaphoric evil snarls such intolerance, discrimination, and victimization that it not only injures its immediate victims, but also shakes our democratic society to its core. Knowingly or unknowingly, prejudiced people bring into the voting booth something of even greater danger to everyone‚Äôs freedom and our country‚Äôs very existence: authoritarianism. As we explained in our earlier chapters, the most prejudiced people in America were likely drawn to Trump because he told them their prejudices were justified. But they connected with him and with one another on more than their attitudes toward minorities, for the showman at the rallies was a megalomaniac and demagogue driven to dominate everyone in the world. He did not campaign on a platform of overthrowing democracy, obviously, but he did sanctify prejudice. And the crowd that responded to his evil message was full of authoritarian supporters yearning for a mighty leader to fight their enemies and protect them.\n\nFrom Authoritarian Nightmare, by John W.

With us the two great divisions of society are not the rich and poor, but white and black; and all the former, the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upper class, and are respected and treated as equals, if honest and industrious; and hence have a position and pride of character of which neither poverty nor misfortune can deprive them.\n\nFor Calhoun and others, it isn't about finances, it's *about having someone beneath you.*	SeductiveSunday	1	2025-06-02 15:21:41	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvkaj8t	t3_1l19pj3	2025-06-02 15:21:54.324729

Generally speaking, about 30 years since the end of the WW I was pretty tough for the areas on both sides of the border. (Also, only part of Ukrainians supported Petlura who cooperated with polish army after WW I) Both sides made sure in local villages to treat the others as bad as possible for over 2 decades. Tensions were increasing over the years more and more and then the frontline came.\n\nPolish populists are trying to re-write the history and convince people that UPA (general resistance movement) = OUN-B (or maybe even a part of OUN-B; small wing of nazi-like fanatics and radical nationalists). As if someone told poles that AK = Brygada ≈öwiƒôtokrzyska.\n\n  \nThat is the root cause for further problems regarding dyplomatic relations around said formations.

For every Persona or good FF entry there are a dozen wheel-spinning padded out snooze fests. Its also a major contributor to why game dev costs have spiraled out of control over the last ten years. It also amounts to nothing. Why spend all that time and money on something less than 25% of your consumers are going to ever see?

USA - Relying on the USA has just shown to be a horrible idea. The government doing a 180 every 4 years is bad for stability and the whole tariff situation is a joke. Additionally, exiting EU is not the status quo and that is one of konfa's talking points.\n4. this is basically the same as 5.

2466	mvlq19w	A quick read of the ingredients and a rummage through your well stocked med cabinet is enough to replicate most compound meds.\n\nThe difference between an AM and PM OTC med is usually an antihistamine. Benedryl (Diphenhydramine) is a fine substitute for its sedating effects if it wasn‚Äôt the very same antihistamine used in the compound. \n\nCompounds are a lot cheaper short term if you don‚Äôt stock your med cabinet, but you can get aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, loperamide, and diphenhydramine for $1 in many places.

2509	mvlqmrx	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) ‚Äî Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd. The FBI immediately described the violence as a ‚Äútargeted terror attack.‚Äù\n\nThe suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù during the Sunday attack on the group of demonstrators, said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI‚Äôs Denver field office.\n\nSoliman was arrested and taken to the hospital for treatment, but authorities didn‚Äôt elaborate on his injuries.\n\nHere is what we know about the attack:\n\nHow the attack unfolded\nAuthorities said the attacker targeted demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run for Their Lives, which organizes run and walk events to call for the immediate release of the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza since they were captured by militants during the incursion into southern Israel that started the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.\n\nThe group had gathered at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and students.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has inflamed global tensions and contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. A week earlier, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot to death in Washington by a man who yelled ‚ÄúI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza‚Äù as he was being led away by police.\n\nPolice in Boulder evacuated multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear.\n\nThe violence occurred four years after 10 people were killed in a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nSeveral people hospitalized\nThe people injured in the Pearl Street attack range in age from 52 to 88.\n\nPhotos from the scene showed a woman lying on the ground in the fetal position with her hair soaked, and a man helping her and getting water from someone with a water jug.\n\nThe injuries authorities found were consistent with reports of people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said, adding that injuries ranged from serious to minor.\n\nRedfearn told reporters Sunday evening that it was too early to discuss a motive but that witnesses were being interviewed.\n\n‚ÄúIt would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe suspect was arrested at the scene\nMohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene. No charges were immediately announced, but officials said they expect to hold him ‚Äúfully accountable.‚Äù\n\nVideo from the scene showed him shirtless and wearing jeans and holding two clear bottles with a transparent liquid in them while shouting at onlookers.\n\nAnother video shows a witness shouting, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right there. He‚Äôs throwing Molotov cocktails,‚Äù as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect.\n\n\nFBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism, and the Justice Department ‚Äî which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations ‚Äî decried the attack as a ‚Äúneedless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,‚Äù FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.	poroo0	1	2025-06-02 15:30:44	news	t	\N	\N	t3_1l1kz93	t3_1l1kz93	2025-06-02 15:30:58.249428

2591	mvlry2d	Yeah, Ukraine could hint it was pulled off using resources or capabilities that don't even exist, just to tie up Russian resources looking for things that don't exist. \n\nThough far from reality and the seriousness of what is happening in Ukraine, this reminds me of an old episode of the late '90's/early 2000''s TV series of "JAG." In one episode the U.S. Navy had developed an experimental sonar technology so sensitive that they could listen to Russian sub crews' spoken conversations employing Russian fluent sonar technicians. A U.S. attack sub thus equipped was shadowing a Russian sub, and in a "Kursk" like scenario (the Kursk sank in Aug. 2000) the U.S. crew using this tech was aware the Russian sub had a torpedo preparing to catastrophically cook-off.\n\nThe U.S. crew didn't want the Russian crew to die, but at the same time they didn't want to alert the Russians of their new super sensitive sonar tech. So they came up with the idea of "confessing" over the radio that the U.S. sub crew knew what was happening onboard the Russian sub, and that they Russians needed to launch the dangerously unstable torpedo, "because CIA spies had infiltrated the Russian naval yards and planted bugs in the new sub during its construction. Thus the Russian crew is spared, the U.S. sonar capability remains a secret, the U.S. Navy looks good for caring more about preserving sailors' lives over espionage, and the Russians will now spend months or years tearing apart their vessels looking for hidden listening devices that don't exist. JAG was often incredibly far-fetched show, but occasionally quite entertaining.	CptArdias	1	2025-06-02 15:37:00	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvfbod7	t3_1l0o3zx	2025-06-02 15:37:16.302885

So many people dove in and bought it for $60-$120 (yes, some suckers still bought TWO copies of this dumpster fire at full price). Never got fixed for switch 1 and it never will. People even bought the $40-$80 dlc too. \n\n\nI patiently waited and snagged a physical copy for $30 on ebay. Got my switch2 coming soon, and footage of the switch 2 patch shows it running smooth at 60 fps (at least on par with pc emulators).

2679	mvltao6	I mean I wouldn't call Nawrocki pro-Russian, he was calling to cut some ties with Putin in March, but unlike his rival Trzaskowski he doesn't agree that supporting Ukraine through military is needed. He said a couple of things that suggest he is slightly pro-Ukraine, or more like anti-Putin, but I would personally classify him as anti-EU and, more than anything, pro-US. There were some waaay more openly pro-Russian candidates in this election, but they got eliminated earlier. Tusk's party, which is where Trzaskowski is meanwhile, is percieved as pro-German (and pro-EU, but apparently 50% of the voters think it's a bad thing), and the phobia against Germany is way stronger in Poland than against the US for instance (which is pretty much non-existant).

They hinge on analysis and survey evidence focused on the specific packaging at issue. Unless the packaging is materially identical in both cases, a suit against one competitor generally isn‚Äôt going to be much help in a suit against a different competitor. It may show that you‚Äôre willing to litigate the case to trial (if that actually winds up happening), but that‚Äôs about it.\n\nJust my two cents as an advertising litigator with Lanham Act experience.

2777	mvlujs5	While I agree with you(I don't buy Nintendo either), it's still worth for them.\n\nFor example, if they run a 20% sale(as in the game cost only 20% of its original value), they would have to make 4 additional sales from people who otherwise would never have bought the game to make up for just 1 additional full price sale from someone. In addition, once the precedent is set that Nintendo has sales, how many people will then simply wait until a sale to buy for future titles? \n\nNintendo is, instead, betting that they make more money without sales and relying on a reputation for quality games to make sales, as well as the knowledge their games will never go on sale, which means there isn't as much of a reason to wait for purchasing. \n\nWhile obviously that's an extreme example of a sale, as most are going to only be 10-20% off, it still illustrates the point. Nintendo is better than the number of sales they get from people like you or me won't out weigh the sales they get from people paying full price, especially knowing Nintendo never does sales as a policy.\n\nFor some games, sales are absolutely, positively worth it, especially games that don't age as well as Nintendo games do(partially because of the stylized graphics, partially because of the game types they normally stick too), versus a game that is designed to be the best looking game, or a multi-player game, which don't age as well as graphics improve, or people burn out and move onto other multi-player games, and the games start to look/feel dated or struggle with low populations. Those make sense to put on sale(especially multi-player games, which need a decent size population for proper matchmaking and maintaining market relevance)	TheGreatWalk	1	2025-06-02 15:49:18	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvkp1ef	t3_1l13bfs	2025-06-02 15:49:34.113302

The story and setting alone carried that game hard for me.\n\nOn the flip side, you have Baldur's Gate 3; which I couldnt finish because I simply lost interest in the story near the final act.

Why bother to polish your game before launch when you can push a pile of garbage out the door and then patch gigabytes of content later.  Especially when none of the business fucks seem to care about long term sales and only worry about the first week, which is 100% hype based anyway.

So having sales later captures all those people who would otherwise walk away, and knowing a sale is coming keeps their interest at least vaguely on the product in the meantime.	bianary	1	2025-06-02 15:59:29	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvk24jl	t3_1l13bfs	2025-06-02 15:59:45.540021

3038	mvlx98u	I've had a lot of misses in more recent years than when I was younger, though, I imagine that also has to do with the general quality of games at launch going downhill significantly. The most recent was probably STALKER 2 (I didn't even need to buy it, but I bought into the marketing and I loved the originals)...a year later and it's still not even in a good technical state on Xbox.\n\nThe only company I have not been disappointed in is RGG Studios, every game they have released, at launch, works and is fun.	trunglefever	1	2025-06-02 16:02:09	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l13bfs	t3_1l13bfs	2025-06-02 16:02:23.219023

It's not bad at all to matchmake. \n\n"asset flip" is not how I interpret the game at all, more of a love letter to the souls series, letting you revisit fights you had years ago with ds1 and ds2 bosses. \n\nThe game is like an arcadey greatest hits remix. \n\nIf your complaint is that it isn't a solo typical souls adventure, grow up and realize that just because something isn't what you wanted, doesn't make it bad.	milkgoddaidan	1	2025-06-02 15:59:36	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1kz8syh	t3_1kz8syh	2025-06-02 15:59:49.587627

3013	mvlwvrs	Yeah, for it to be a true moral problem what the game tells you at the start should have been true - "Harvest the Little Sisters = More Adam", "Save the Little Sisters = Less Adam". If they actually followed through on that and then later judged the player on their choice narratively, it would have worked a lot better.\n\nAs you say, too many games treat moral dilemmas like the "marshmellow test" in psychology. "You can have this one marshmellow now OR if you wait patiently for an hour, you can have TWO marshmellows." That's not a moral test. That's a patience test.

You have to extract value from your game as early as possible or perish. Obviously there has to be a balance between quality and early access, but so many indie games could not be made if we couldn't release rough versions early, for people who are willing to put up with bugs and instability. \n\nAs an indie dev, I am grateful to all the players willing to take risks on EA games to be de facto play testers to help make the game great in the long run.	feels_r_reals	1	2025-06-02 16:01:06	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvkeodu	t3_1l13bfs	2025-06-02 16:01:19.781696

3049	mvlxgic	I tried both Manjaro and Arch a few years ago and ran into significant issues frequently; file browser bugs, fullscreen bugs, gpu driver instability, audio, mouse input/keyboard input, etc. \n\nI like how apps are installed and updated in Linux using package managers, and using them helped me discover that the same types of package managers are available on Windows. It was slightly annoying that every morning I would open my laptop while brewing my morning coffee and have dozens of new updates to install, but that's a very minor complaint. It's just like 15 minutes of updates every day. \n\nI was able to troubleshoot all of the issues I had, but I can imagine for people who aren't tech savvy, or maybe they are but they just don't want to fuss about with it, that could be a complete deal breaker, just having any possibility that suddenly your PC might not be able to sleep properly, or suddenly your F-keys stop working, or countless other issues. \n\nI would LOVE it if I could use a Linux distro without the possibility of these issues, but in my experience, it simply isn't there yet. I'm hoping to be proven wrong as soon as possible. I wouldn't want to switch to Linux on my main desktop yet, but I have a laptop that I'd be willing to test drive Linux on again.

3065	mvlxp6q	I loved that about Wasteland 3. \n\nUnlike a lot of games where doing the good and moral thing would reward you better eventually, even if you were giving up an immediate reward, in Wasteland 3, if they gave you a choice between saving someone and getting better gear - if you chose to save the person you would NEVER get the better gear.\n\nI thought it made the choices genuinely compelling, when so many other games reward the player with better stuff for being a "good person", meaning there is no sacrifice and thus no real difficult choice.

3075	mvlxwd3	I believe all the books by the original author have been adapted as movies by know. Also if I remember correctly book Bond is not a fit suave super spy, but a fat, chain smoking, alcoholic. Whose entire internal and sometimes external dialogue while around woman is just misogynistic comments. (I mean that by the standards of the time period they came out in.) So while it would be funny to see people‚Äôs heads explode at a book accurate Bond. The characterization would probably wear thin fast.

3144	mvlzboj	This has nothing to do with food, but it's some nice food for thought: when cialis and Viagra were still proprietary, they cost about $20-25 per pill. However, you could buy bulk powder online from other countries for very cheap. $0.90 per gram, or 200 daily doses of cialis. That means the markup on that drug was at least 4500x. Of course, those companies from China etc were also making a profit so realistically it was likely over 5000x markup from the manufacturing cost.  \n  \nPharma could have gotten every man over 40 in the country to take daily cialis for the rest of their lives at $1/dose and still made disgusting profit.  \n  \nIn conclusion, fuck capitalism.

3222	mvm0kc8	I haven‚Äôt played the game much and either didn‚Äôt experience this yet or have forgotten it but man it just triggered a super nostalgic memory from another game. Some of the first games I really got into were the Quest for Glory and the King‚Äôs Quest games that came out of Sierra mostly in the 80s and 90s. \n\nThe 4th game in the Quest for Glory series was both the best one of the series and one of the buggiest games that has ever shipped. And this was back before they were really capable of doing online updates. Later on there were fan made fixes that you could download. \n\nAnyway I digress. The reason your paragraph was so nostalgic is that in that game you had these dream sequences that consisted of only swirly colors and a voiceover describing the dream. By the way one of the best things they did on that game was hire Jonathan Rhys-Davies to do all the narration. So it was him telling you what was in these dreams. It was such a good game! Also it was the FIRST game that Jennifer Hale did voice work for!!	Twistfaria	1	2025-06-02 16:18:16	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvkdl16	t3_1l0jz2z	2025-06-02 16:18:30.492575

3230	mvm0roe	Can you provide peer-reviewed, verified studies that back up your claims that bringing production back to the US will strengthen the middle-class? Additionally, show how bringing production back to the US will increase wages and lower prices. Give specific examples.\n\nHow long will it take to bring production back to the US? Is this something that will happen before MAGA loses the Executive? You seems smart, hopefully smart enough to realize that there‚Äôs no way MAGA will still be in power in a few years, not to mention the midterms.\n\nI‚Äôm guessing companies like Nvidia will pretend that their bringing back production to the US, but they‚Äôll just wait MAGA out until they‚Äôre out of power.

3247	mvm10q6	You get it. Many people don't really know how some of these manufacturers work. The downtime to change out a recipe would be more expensive than a slight tweaks to the recipe's cost in some cases. Plenty of brands will sell their product with other labels for less because it's guaranteed sales of large quantities. Even bulk and scale only get you so far. Once you are buying a truckload of a product at a time, buying more rarely is going to save you money. Freight and distribution networks will have a bigger impact on price at that point.

3294	mvm1mxf	I sometimes feel this argument. \n\nBut then I look at my own student loan from when I went back to get my masters as an adult. I was reimbursed by my company based on grades received, so not until after the term finished‚Äîabout 6-8 weeks if I filed as soon as my grade was updated on my transcript (awesome program, btw). I took out a Federal student loan to front the cost until I got reimbursed by my company each term. It was a six term, two year program, $3,500 per term ($14k total). \n\nMost terms I paid out of pocket as soon as the term was up and then pocketed the reimbursement from my company since it took a few weeks to process.  \n\nI missed my third term of paying off the loan within the month ending of the term. I had a large personal expense so I waited for my company to reimburse me for the tuition and sent the payment about six weeks after the term ended.\n\nI paid off all the rest within the month timeline but missing that one term screwed it all up. I, unbeknownst to me at the time, no longer qualified for the 30 day grace period and didn‚Äôt realize it. My interest started accruing at the point that particular loan was missed at the beginning of term 3, meaning 1.25 years of interest. Keep in mind, I didn‚Äôt get a bill until after I graduated. There was no tuition on it. Just interest. I had never gotten a bill for the interest during school, saw no record of it in my account when I went in each term to pay (it just read the tuition only amount). There was no visible way for me to see the interest I owed or to pay it.\n\nMy interest was just shy of 1k. Just the interest for 1.25 years for that ONE term of $3,500 that was paid off within six weeks of the term ending.\n\nI get it‚ÄîBad on me for not realizing that my loan was not deferred (I had one semester of loans for my undergrad at 21 and it was deferred). I assumed since it was a federal loan I had until I graduated. \n\nAnd I disputed this and within the conversations, it was difficult for the lender to find those terms, but they were there. And also the explanation that the interest wouldn‚Äôt be charged until graduation (but did accrue). It was deceptive.\n\nSo I try to assume many families had a similar issue as me. But with them it snowballed because they weren‚Äôt getting the reimbursement to pay it off. \n\nHad I done this at the beginning of my first term, I would have owed as much in interest as a whole term of school for only two years!

3352	mvm2j1u	The key words being "deliberately" and "if". \n\nTo some extent even when targeting military infrastructure you will also affect civilians. I also don't think resistance must be perfect and never kill a civilian, that's an ideological position not reality. Doesn't mean they are terrorist even if they have civilians casualties. \n\nUltimately he is right, Putin is entirely at fault for the situation, he could have stopped when he wanted and saved thousands of lives. Every death is on his conscience. \n\n9/11 is a terrorist attack, but also a clear reaction of what happened in the middle east. We simply cannot divorce from the reasons those attacks happens, they rarely if ever happen completely out of nowhere.

Some of us literally want to play a healer in a party. Some of us want to want to have some weighty combat where physical attacks feel more physical and less 'magical particle juice emitting from every sword swing'. \n\n\nC) Please bother to do some research and take a look at Dragons Dogma (Dragons Dogma Online) to show how good combat systems can be in multiplayer. Where melee characters feel like melee.\n\n\nD) Please avoid copy/pasting modern loot systems. It's just too all over the place now. Completing a level and getting a loot box at the end to loot it or having some 'wacky' method of unlocking items. Can we put some effort into having something like Morrowinds lovely item system with Left Pauldron/Right Pauldrons and Left Glove/Right Glove. With a chest piece, greaves, and boots.

Is that really being unnecessarily pedantic? \n\nAnyway, even I thought **Starcraft Ghost** looked pretty cool back then (even though, iirc, the crouch walking animation looked suspiciously similar to Sam Fisher's) and was curious about it being a gateway into that IP for me and was disappointed that they couldn't bring it together for a release. But I don't mind one bit when a dev has quality standards about what they put out and cancellations are an unfortunate necessity sometimes.

3424	mvm3d9y	Totally agreed. I'd also say that, even if you're not willing to wait for months/a year+ to play a game, at the very least you should resist the temptation to pre-order. \n\nI promise that whatever shiny incentives the publisher is dangling as a pre-order bonus will be added to the game at some point anyways, and you'll have the added benefit of getting to see other people's reactions/reviews and judging for yourself whether the game is worth your money. Plus, pretty much every game these days typically gets a day-one patch along with additional patches to address whatever major launch issues crop up. Even waiting a week or two after launch can make a major difference in how much you enjoy a game.\n\nAlso, yes to Clair Obscure: Expedition 33.

If I pull the mag out of my gun, and suddenly need to interrupt the reload to do something else, the empty magazine shouldn‚Äôt magically return to my gun and need to be removed again. The other thing that drives me crazy that most games get wrong is the charging handle. I know that hand pulling and releasing the handle is a cool way to finish the animation, but if there was still a round in the chamber from the previous magazine it‚Äôs completely unnecessary and should eject a shell when it‚Äôs done on anything but an empty weapon.¬†	EclipseNine	1	2025-06-02 16:34:23	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1lzha	t3_1l1lzha	2025-06-02 16:34:36.217248

3484	mvm3zf4	This sort of upkeep is just fundamentally un-fun, IMO. It's a part of reality we play games to escape from.  \n\nIt only works in two contexts:  \n* The entire game is built around it (Don't Starve, Fear & Hunger, etc.) and these games tend to be stressful by design  \n* It's just a contrivance to put a soft timer on the game loop (Valheim, Tarkov)  \n\nThe best is maybe Green Hell which falls into the first group, where you not only have to eat but have to hit your macros or else suffer various ailments and ultimately death. But, again, it's stressful. You have to WANT to spend your time managing a demanding survival system in an environment that's constantly trying to kill you.

3502	mvm45nu	From what Ive seen It seems like its not just one side being bad but both. As in, at its core conservatism and progresism might be opposed views but they're not bad on their own. Unless im wrong, Conservatism seemed to be about maintaining the status quo and maintaining tradition and looking out for themselves while progressism was about keeping up with the times and giving importance to cooperating and accepting other cultures.\n\n\nBut because all that matters is Who becomes president, when one side failed they would become more aggresive in their stance in the followup election to try to win. In turn, they also essentially pitted the voters of one party against the voters of the other, a Sort of "us vs them" scenario.¬†\n\n\nMy country is currently ruled by a left leaning party, but Only because they joined with 7 other parties to be able to govern. If they hadn't, the right would have been able to rule because they had more votes.\n\n\nSome people are angry some of those he pacted with are independentists (Think of It like Brexit, but within a country), to become their own independent country. Some of the policies were poorly formulated to sell votes, but when put in practice had the exact opposite effect they claimed would solve. Theres also the Okupas problem, where people are concerned someone could break into your home when you're away and start living there, and you could not do anything about It.¬†\n\n\nWhat does the government when these concerns are brought up? Doubling down. So these people start looking at the opposite, like the far right. In turn, the left sees an increase in the right and doubles down again. And the people in the right double down too... Its a vicious cycle that polarizes people and heats up the political climate.

How many mid-sized studios sell out or gleefully sell to publishers to then be shuttered later? \n\nNothing would change on that front. \n\n>Its called laying people off and shutting studios. Doing more conservative measures. MT being a focal point so it raises your quarterly profits. The exact opposite of what patient gamers want.\n\nIf people magically had the self-control to wait for products to be worth it to be polished to be quality... do you think they'd be going all in on MTX.\n\nAnd like I said it's a scenario that won't happen anyway, but if it some magical how did happen that consumers acquired sell control the industry would have to adapt to the customer.	dookarion	1	2025-06-02 16:36:21	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm3jv3	t3_1l13bfs	2025-06-02 16:36:32.990758

3568	mvm4xjr	Realistically anyone new to Linux, should try to be on an immutable and user friendly distro, like Fedora Silverblue, Kinoite, or Bazzite, and then just use flatpaks, of cause even software specifically made for the SteamDeck, can come as a appimage, which strays away from Flatpak, and they're much more manual.\n\nI've never really had those issues, but I know most PC users, use Nvidia, and I use AMD, so it could be that, along with Arch not being aimed at main stream.\n\nWhen the OS is pre-installed, none of those issues should occur, since the hardware manufacturer has given the green light to that version of Linux on that hardware.\n\nMy brother did have a problem with some full screen games on Kinoite actually, so we ran a command in the terminal to move him to Bazzite, and since then he hasn't had any issue, since he majoritally games on the thing, I should have considered Bazzite first, but yeah, I've seen full screen issues with some games, hopefully the more users, the more these kinda bugs are ironed out.\n\nThe less users the less incentive there is to iron these bugs.\n\nSometimes Linux just isn't ready for someone, it is but they struggle to make the leap because its so different, or it just ultimately isn't for them.\n\nPersonally, I don't care if Linux gets the lions share on Desktop, or if it stays a minority forever, I only care that it gets enough users that if someone **wants** to use Linux, the question is, "Would I rather use Windows or Linux" not, "Will this online game work, and does Adobe work on Linux"	PhoenixLandPirate	1	2025-06-02 16:39:18	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvlxgic	t3_1l1dhda	2025-06-02 16:39:29.137705

3645	mvm5q0a	Natural conversations. It's one thing to do it well in cutscenes, but having it be interactive is so rare it may as well not exist. If you've played Oxenfree, you know.  \n\nI think it's just really hard to do well, hence we have just a couple of games that have it as their defining feature.  \n\nEven if AAA devs implemented it, there are accessibility concerns.  \n\nIt's an area where I'd like to see more creative solutions. Like maybe you don't choose exactly what your character says, but you can choose the mood of their response consistently by holding a button or pushing in a direction? That way you can rapidly choose your emotional response to something and the game can smoothly transition from there.

3701	mvm6fj4	Citizens United is the reason for the oligarchal hellscape we now live in.  Very few politicians work for the interest of the masses.  Most of them work for their own self interests and bank accounts. Everything is designed to exploit for the rich. These people have ran actuarial stats on everything too figure out how to keep everyone rent check to rent check.  Housing, groceries, healthcare, electricity, merchandising, everything. Everything is priced and built to maximize profits over quality.  Otherwise we would still be able to buy a refrigerator that last 50 years instead of 5.  Obviously this wasn't an issue in the past or their wouldn't be refrigerators that are still running efficiently from 1960.

3715	mvm6j8q	This is me. Waited almost 2 years before buying BG3 because I refuse to pay full price for games and it never was on sale in the PS Store. I've been waiting for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 to drop in price. I know it's on sale right now, but still $55 seems like a pretty high price. \n\n\nAs another note, check to see if your local library has a video game section. I recently found this out and checked out Assassin's Creed Shadows. I knew I wasn't going to buy the game, but it looked like fun so I didn't mind checking it out for the week. Some libraries also have request forms so if they do have video gams but not the one(s) you want you can request it and they my add it to their catalog or have another nearby library that does have it send it to them.	gnarcotics1	1	2025-06-02 16:46:54	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l13bfs	t3_1l13bfs	2025-06-02 16:47:06.27168

3844	mvm7wbl	Yes, and it‚Äôs why all these medications are safe alternatives. That doesn‚Äôt mean their effects are identical. Even the same pill manufactured by the same company can have different effects in two different people. When you add in an entirely different manufacturer/quality controller it‚Äôs a whole host of new variables. For a majority of purchasers there is no significant difference. But that‚Äôs not necessarily true for all. And again, I‚Äôm not trying to look down on generics. I buy mostly generic medications OTC. The bigger thing we‚Äôre talking about is consumers having to distinguish between branding that provides value, vs branding that doesn‚Äôt all the time.

3887	mvm8cwz	Adams did NOT get a pardon. What he got was the Justice Department generously deciding to drop the charges against him but also retain the right to charge him again in the future if they ever wanted to.\n\nWhich is not all that unusual, but there was ALSO the fact that Adams and Tom Homan went on the news and Homan said out loud that they were dropping the charges in return for Adams directing NYC employees to assist the Federal government's immigrant blackbagging program.\n\nThat is a blatant example of a criminal defendant getting preferable treatment in exchange for doing whatever the prosecutor wants them to do and is nakedly, wildly coercive.\n\nThat's why the judge in the case overruled the Justice Department and dropped the charges without the ability to re-file them. He told the Justice Department that it was within their purview to drop the case, but they absolutely could not have any take-backsies with that decision, and that dropping the case meant dropping it permanently. And that's what happened.\n\nThe whole sordid spectacle was an enormous black eye for the Justice Department. A lot of longtime attorneys quit or let themselves get fired over it and the Justice Department flushed decades' worth of credibility down the toilet. You used to be able to more or less trust them; as it stands now, only an idiot would ever believe that the Justice Department does anything for the reasons they claim. They are just grifters and liars, now. Everything they do is tainted with suspicion. This whole situation represents the Justice Department admitting in public that they don't seek justice at all, only vengeance and self-promotion. \n\nFlip off a Justice Department lawyer if you meet one, anybody who's still there and hasn't quit for the greener pastures of private practice is there by choice.

3907	mvm8ktx	>"At odds with reality" but acts like separating groups based on fear isn't racism\n\nYou're conflating a minority groups fear *of* a majority group with a majority group's fear of the minority group. They are not the same, and your failure to recognize that is evidence that you either don't know the difference or you refuse to understand the difference, and thus don't care.\n\n>Marginalizing groups based on fear is racism. Full stop.\n\nWhite people have never been, cannot be, and never will be, marginalized. In part, or in whole. This is fundamental to the argument at hand. White people are the perpetual majority, the group in power. Their rights are not, and have never been, restricted by virtue of being white.\n\nAnd it is STILL a difference of a group wanting to be protected from the majority in a space vs. a group excluding a minority from a space. \n\n>As someone from the south that grew up around it in many forms I can promise you that separating based on fear is a key foundation for systemic and lifelong racism.\n\nMinority communities, generally, are insular because of the oppression they have experienced and dealt with for generations. They get to decide who they let in, who they trust. White people don't get to impose their presence in those spaces, nor do they get to bitch and moan because they're not allowed in due to their behaviors and their beliefs.\n\nWhen white people stop perceiving any measure of equality or equity benefitting a minority group as an attack on their power, maybe then we'll have some real progress.	emelbee923	1	2025-06-02 16:56:28	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm78mx	t3_1kzcl5a	2025-06-02 16:56:39.277178

3915	mvm8mjb	There was a conundrum with games like The Last of Us that I and most have been pretty comfortable just suspending disbelief on in the meantime, but it‚Äôs that in a world of more grounded stories where you shoot somebody one or two times and they die, like in real life, how do we get over the need for gameplay that result in extensive shooting galleries of nearly real human beings?\n\nWe need gameplay to engage with, but it‚Äôs outrageous and sometimes a narrative hurdle to have to mow down two dozen guys every mission. The solution in games that are stylized is that enemies don‚Äôt need to die as easily as real people, they can have big glowing weak spots and so on. I reckon the solution may lie in some really advanced AI in the NPCs that can potentially produce dynamic and taut shootouts but I wonder if we‚Äôll always have this disconnect between gameplay and immersion. Can an advanced AI that takes cover intelligently produce gameplay that‚Äôs even fun? Would it just reproduce the frightening but stillborn reality of a true gun battle?

3958	mvm90eo	I consider myself a very tech savvy person. Since a very young age, I've always loved tinkering with the settings of any device/software, especially on PC. I'm not afraid of the terminal, or networking settings, BIOS, editing/writing scripts, etc. I'm the type of person that actually likes reading manuals and documentation to understand what every setting/feature does and then optimizing stuff. It's a hobby of mine. I'm always researching new software and learning about all of its settings in depth.\n\nI wanted to try distros that were more geared toward 'power users.' I'm confident that I followed the instructions and guides correctly, and I still ran into the various major issues that I mentioned. I was able to resolve them but in the process I learned that Linux is not necessarily reliable to always work as expected. From your description, it sounds like the 'fool-proof/user-friendly' distros are also not immune to the random issues like fullscreen mode breaking in games. \n\nI would greatly prefer to daily drive a Linux system. I know that most of the world's major servers/data centers run on Linux, and when it's configured correctly it can be highly performant. So, there is hope.\n\nBut I think for people who want to game and use workstation software like 3D modeling software, video editors, etc., that all rely heavily on graphics drivers and frequent updates, Linux is not really an option. Not without serious compromises that make it not worth it. Hence only ~2.5% of gamers use it.\n\nI know it's also not completely the burden of the collective Linux developers. It's largely the responsibility of companies like Nvidia/AMD, Adobe, Autodesk, Maxon, etc., to support Linux as a platform. So, I hope that happens as soon as possible.

3971	mvm97cg	It's not difficult to get right, but your physics engine is usually already running many interactions in your game scene at least 60 times a seconds. Some of that stuff can be run in isolation, some in parallel, some of that stuff depends on the physical state of other objects (see hair and character collision data). You can either let the CPU handle it and bottleneck other, more important, physics states to a backlog, or you can let the GPU handle it as a shader by referencing some already calculated CPU states, albeit not as often and not as promptly. So because it's usually a shader handled by GPU that doesn't update as close to real time as the rest of the game physics, you'll see clipping. \n\nYou could have the hair have its own dedicated collision data, with each chunk of hair having its own 'rope physics' (see:expensive) hogging the physics engine at 60 Hz, but that means enemies, NPCs, projectiles, weapons, dropped destructible objects, persistent items in-world, terrain, trees, buildings, etc. would all take a backseat (and then you get people complaining about how modern games don't let arrows stay on the ground like they do in Skyrim, because they chose to prioritize more sophisticated cloth and hair physics).	homiedude180	1	2025-06-02 16:59:22	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm2fox	t3_1l1lzha	2025-06-02 16:59:36.076229

Gamepads all work, no tinkering. I don't have to open a command prompt/terminal or edit any config files or anything. And I swear I don't mean "as a Linux nerd, I don't have to tinker (except for all the things I'm so familiar with that I don't consider it tinkering)", I genuinely mean absolutely zero poking. \n\nLinux does have a stigma associated with it, rightfully so, historically.

4057	mvma86m	I really hoped the industry would move in more of a AA direction after Hellblade 1 was such a huge success back in 2017. A couple of my favorite games from that year released for only $30 to $40 at launch. This game basically gave me that same feeling, but in an even more WTF sense in a good way. This game looks absolutely gorgeous. The humans are just realistic enough but also don't fall into uncanny valley. It has a fantastic art style with great character design. This game legit has perhaps the greatest orchestral score ever made for a video game, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that the soundtrack is 8 hours of sheer beauty. It has great acting and even Hollywood talent involved with Daredevil voicing one of the most prominent characters. The game isn't a bloated RPG like the recent AC games or Starfield, but it's also not a short game either since the main quest alone takes about 30 hours to beat without diving into side content. You get all of that in top tier quality for the price of $50 while larger developers and publishers are selling games for $70 and now $80 that don 't have nearly as much substance as Expedition 33 or they piecemeal the content. What are we doing here? Why are there worse or lesser experiences being priced at $80?	TheNittanyLionKing	1	2025-06-02 17:04:11	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mv1oq1w	t3_1kz1a7b	2025-06-02 17:04:23.652792

4092	mvmasn3	UE has had problems for a long time and my theory is they don't really care because they're aiming UE to be bigger than gaming kind of like how nvidia is more of an AI company than gaming these days which is why their drivers are catastrophically bad lately.\n\nThey've been trying to get movie studios to use UE so I think gaming uses are getting less priority than before, maybe not nearly as bad as how nvidia is neglecting gaming (yet), but definitely worse than they were in the UE3 and 4 days.

4100	mvmawv8	This family moved in next door to the house we bought. Too many incidents to list, but the brother of the woman who lived there kept showing up at 6:00 a.m. to drop off his girlfriend, who worked with his sister. The guy had one of those super loud stereos that he blasted, so I asked one of the kids who he was so I could report him. Turned out he was an accessory to a gangland slaying and had spent time in prison for it. He'd also tried to run a guy over in a parking lot, and was arrested for stabbing his brother-in-law in the face, but yeah, let's let him be out on the streets fucking with people. The police had zero interest in dealing with him, but the BIL that was stabbed who was living next door was a convicted sex offender and I reported him because he hadn't told his parole officer that he'd moved, so he had to move out.

In-house engines can be great, but unless you're an EA/T2/Capcom today you *probably* don't have the resources.

4168	mvmbitu	>For most of the last century,  \nThus, it was rare for extremist views to make it very far.\n\nThat is only partially true. The Nazis for example effectively used radio and newspapers to reach a large part of the population, even before they came into power.\n\nIt's mostly true for the latter half of the 20th century though. What we saw then was a better understanding of what the media could and should not do, precisely because of how the Nazis had abused the media to gain control over Germany.\n\nI definitely agree about the lower cost of propaganda, but will add that the impact of individuals is marginal.

4169	mvmbivd	>If people magically had the self-control to wait for products to be worth it to be polished to be quality... do you think they'd be going all in on MTX?\n\nyet that is the point, people don't have self control so you are just signalling that its not worth making games that respect gamers since these idiots buy slop while dedicated singleplayer games just aren't worth the trouble. In the game of some money or "all the money" the company will always pick the option for "ALLL THE MONEY"\n\n>How many mid-sized studios sell out or gleefully sell to publishers to then be shuttered later? \n\nCan't fault the devs, gamer entitlement is a huge problem. Expectations are insane and publishers are there to milk them. Being a game dev sucks, its a field riff with exploitation because the industry knows it can churn through so much people because people want that job therefore they shouldn't care about burning people out. \n\n>And like I said it's a scenario that won't happen anyway, but if it some magical how did happen that consumers acquired sell control the industry would have to adapt to the customer.\n\ngamers already had a chance and it mostly failed, self publishing was the future without AAA publishers but gamers faced similar dilemma as publishers. Where irresponsible devs waste a shit ton of money. Gamers easily fall for hype and encourage devs to feature creep their projects because to gamers it means they get more product at the same value.

If I want/need to scroll down for map I should be able to.\n\nYou should be able to change the HUD. Anything from moving where things are because you have a blind spot to just wanting a more minimal HUD.\n\nMore fine tuned audio options. So many games offer Master, Music, and game volumes. For example, I like having ambient sound to help with immersion but would like to turn down combat sounds a bit.\n\nAnd that's what I came up with as a able-bodies person that doesn't \\*need\\* it.

4196	mvmbs0q	That'd be poorly implemented TAA. Temporal anti-aliasing uses data from multiple frames to get rid of jagged lines and clean up the image. Downside to that is that objects move and if you don't correct for that then you get ghosting and afterimages. \n\nThe higher your frame rate the less of a problem this becomes, as the data from the previous frame is closer to the frame that is currently being drawn. And a well implemented TAA system will make sure to correct the image. But that requires manual tweaking to get it just right, which costs time and money that quite a few publishers just don't want to spend. \n\nTech like Nvidia's DLSS, AMD FSR and Intel's XESS are also temporal based techniques, but all use a well designed algorithm (and/or machine learning shenanigans) to prevent ghosting and reconstruct the image from a lower resolution.	drmirage809	1	2025-06-02 17:11:28	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmajcy	t3_1l1mxmr	2025-06-02 17:11:41.800935

4225	mvmc12u	3D with shutter glasses (also frequently called "active 3D" as the glasses contain active electronics) actually were far more commonly paired with LCD displays than with CRT. The response time of a high quality LCD is already good enough, and you were kind of limited to the response time of LCD anyway as far as avoiding cross-talk goes as the glasses often used LCD technology to black out the lenses.\n\nLCD TVs or monitors generally even work better for 3D compared to CRTs as LCDs can generally achieve far higher brightness. The glasses block a lot of the light (partially from being blacked out half the time, partially from being not fully transparent when not blacked out), so a 3D movie still often looked a bit dim even on a high-end LCD at max brightness.	ben_g0	1	2025-06-02 17:12:37	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvg0ub7	t3_1l0nlbj	2025-06-02 17:12:52.641344

In order to properly render skin, the rendering engine needs to more accurately compute the way the light interacts with the flesh, and the varying properties of the flesh itself that influence the light. There also need to be advanced denoisers that don't scrub out all of the detail in the skin.	CaveManta	1	2025-06-02 17:14:21	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm0uzk	t3_1l1lzha	2025-06-02 17:14:32.013527

4308	mvmcvud	An economy, by which I mean a few things. First of.all, the numbers never feel balanced throughout a given game; you always struggle to have enough money until some mid-point when money becomes trivial, either because there's nothing to buy or you have all the money.\n\nSecondly, shops don't make sense as businesses. 100% you sell more to shops than you ever buy, often buy a lot, and usually buy selling a *ton* of the same or very similar things. What shop buys things from customers anyway? How many swords does this town of twenty people even need? And why does the alchemist buy them?\n\nAnd finally, it's always bothered me that I can pick up any random item and immediately know how much it's worth (and what it does) and no one ever tries to rip you off. You never find a helmet that you think is worth 100 gold, but none of the merchants are willing to offer you more than 10. No one ever tries to sell you something with stats other than advertised, like you buy mithral sword but find out it's just painted tin.

He's currently out on bail and not allowed in our town for a different case of harassment where he threw a rock through the back window of a moving car that drove through his road blockade. Its been peaceful.	Xplodicon2	1	2025-06-02 17:20:16	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm41lr	t3_1l1mfld	2025-06-02 17:20:27.05518
4382	mvmdooi	This is my interpretation as well. My understanding is the KoTH reboot chose not to bring him back, but never said anything bad about him. \n\nYou've got to wonder if they interviewed him and realized he was not mentally sound and decided not to bring him back because of it. \n\nTruly sad, but I can't imagine this is all one long stretch of bad luck when it could all be explained, even his house burning down, by him becoming unhinged.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the fuck out of that game but traversal stutters are all over the game, especially with uncapped fps. Cutscenes have bad frame pacing which makes them get noticeable stutters.

4436	mvmecyr	Well, I‚Äôm not sure how true that $36,000 is. BLS puts it as $24,000 in 2005 (2nd graph), so inflation wise modern median wages are higher by a few thousand. That $36,000 might be average? Which in that case I‚Äôll trust the median over the average for wages. They aren‚Äôt as sensitive to wages of the rich.\n\nIn your specific cases, I have no idea about money in your case! But in the first graph it is real wages, so adjusted for increases in rent, food costs, clothes, etc for essentially a wage relative to prices. It‚Äôs in weekly wages, but there is yearly wages you can do too. And in terms of groceries 2005 Americans spent like 10% of their income on food. Nowadays, 11%. I do think rent has crept up as total percent of wages, but even then. Through all the graphs and data I have seen people still have higher real wages. So‚Ä¶ yeah. Still not seeing that strong of evidence to support that specific part of your claims.	DarthFleeting	1	2025-06-02 17:23:26	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvjbsj3	t3_1l17zjm	2025-06-02 17:23:44.05695

4444	mvmefaj	I consider myself quite techy now, but before Linux I wasn't.  \nI was big on Mac, but when I couldn't afford a Mac, I had to get a Windows Laptop, and I just can't do Windows, especially since those days, it was Windows 8, but no Windows has ever agreed with me.  \nI found out about Ubuntu, accidentally deleted my Windows drive, then never looked back.  \nI became techy after installing Linux, and listening to podcasts, etc, etc.\n\nYeah every computer has those kind of issues, I think it was Assasins creed, that just wouldn't work on Windows, and they said "just don't update windows if you want to play Assasins creed", but it's getting better, the issue was odd though, because it worked fine on external monitors, I never noticed the issue, but on the laptop monitor, it did, was weird.\n\nI only half agree here, for 3D modeling and many animation works, Linux is better, for Video Editing however, we are sadly lacking.\n\nWith Video games, many games run a lot better on Linux than they do on Windows, I think if people only used Windows to play games, there'd be a bigger shift, but then we have anti-cheat issues to, along with the "better the devil I know" situation.\n\nNvidia is bad at supporting Linux, but they are getting better, AMD is great with supporting Linux, but yeah, I have over 900 games on Steam, and I think less than 10 have issues on Linux, but of those 10 that have issues on Linux, like 3 of them I'm very sure would still have issues on Windows, however, I can't test them to check again.\n\nI'd really love to have a fantastic video editor in Linux, we have Blender, kdenlive, and a paid one I can't even think of right now, that a lot of people use, but I'd love something that's at the level of Adobe Premier, I used that a decent amount at Uni, and not having some of the features Premier has in such a simple way, in Blender of Kdenlive, is frustrating, so I get sticking behind for some of those big apps, that you can't leave, even if its just for a feature or two.

4484	mvmeuk6	A lot has changed in the last 5-7 years, though. Even from when I started working on games, there's a big shift in the technical landscape.\n\nIt was more practical to build your own engine 10-15 years ago, even, but a lot has changed since the 2000s and 2010s in terms of tech.\n\nYes, you can build a custom engine and it can be SUPER efficient. But that's a massive cost, and for a big 3D game that means hiring tons of people who will maintain and update it. Upside: the engine is likely to be super good at what you want it to do (think IW engine for CoD). Downside: it probably will be super focused on whatever title it's built for (think about how much trouble Frostbite cost the rest of EA).\n\nYou can call it "cheap," but it's also just... prudent. Like, say it would cost you 8 figures to develop an engine that will be more bleeding edge than UE5 is, you gotta figure out how to capitalize that cost. If you're making a series like CoD, it's easy to justify. But for a one and done like Witcher 4, is it worth it? \n\nThese days when people want games to have ray tracing ultra HDR 4K path traced upscaling DLSS 8 particle lumen acceleration, you just want that shit dealt with by someone else first so you can focus on building the game you want. If you're Infinity Ward or Treyarch, sure, you can hire out a team to do that and keep them going for years. But CDPR despite their relative heft doesn't have annualized titles to justify that.

Which again, is ridiculous, because a bunch of store brands do the exact same thing.\n\nMondelez seems to be wanting to upend the apple cart and lay claim to to product design when they really have no real claim to it.

4522	mvmfaha	Honestly I disagree\n\nFor Bosses, there‚Äôs 165 bosses in the base game (207 with the DLC), with maybe 4-5 getting repeated constantly (ancient dragons, Tree Guardians, Tree Spirits, Gargoyles and tree Sentinels (the repeated bosses bring the total to 235+ bosses).\n\nDark souls 3 has 25 bosses. and that‚Äôs with both DLCs. \n\nFor enemies, there‚Äôs over 140 enemy types to fight against, which is double or more than every other FromSoftware game (based off base game)\n\nDark souls 3 has 140+ enemy types, but that‚Äôs, again, With the DLC. (70-80 in the base game)\n\nThe collectibles I have no issue with, because that fuels the need to explore more, in order to upgrade equipment. If I only ever got collectibles that were needed, and exactly where I needed them, they wouldn‚Äôt be collectibles anymore and I would grow bored of the effortless upgrading. \n\nFor dungeons, it‚Äôs meant to be restricting but I never found any two dungeons to be the same, the mini boss room was the same everytime, but that‚Äôs it. Plus there was no real reason to explore every dungeon as none had real significant value, besides a handful, but that‚Äôs because they had good loot inside. \n\nWhat do you mean by lots of empty spaces? The areas in Elden Ring felt very natural for a map with number of large cities and mountains. The wildlife made sense too.

4535	mvmfdug	The example you used is the example I'd say does it well. The Witcher 3 is one of the longest games I've played, but I never got bored during the whole thing. You just gotta see the adventure as the goal, not the endpoint. The Persona series is the other game series that does long games well, I think. \n\n  \nThe real problem imo is when a game is long for the sake of being long, or when a game is way too short. Padding the length of a game is dumb, and short games feel like you don't get your money's worth (RE3: Remake?). A lot of the JRPG's I've played also feel entirely too long, but that's because they also feel grindy and it feels like the story just doesn't move for long periods of time. Witcher 3 never felt that way at all to me. Even the side quests in that game felt meaningful.	Machoopi	1	2025-06-02 17:28:07	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm1vbj	t3_1l1lzha	2025-06-02 17:28:21.045725

4543	mvmfh1k	I hear this all the time but you need to understand how journalism works.\n\nYou can't just say "x murdered y" without a conviction because you'd be opening yourself up to a libel suit.\n\nIt's also irresponsible to make a claim without a verdict because, if that person is actually innocent, you could ruin their life with an inaccurate accusation. And while news orgs have made retractions in the past, that often doesn't do much to quell outrage at them.\n\nThis headline says the same thing as "Jonathon Joss murdered by neighbor" but it does so without making direct claims lacking a factual basis. They presented the facts. There was a shooting following a dispute with a neighbor, and Jonathon Joss is now dead. Those are all the facts we have, and anything else is conjecture until it sits before a judge.\n\nI know the neighbor murdered him, you know it, we all know it, but it's a legal minefield to report on this stuff since our culture is growing increasingly litigous, so they have to do so responsibly.\n\nApply this to every headline you read, and please note that orgs who *don't* follow this principle are likely not very reputable.

You agree to that spying when you buy those products. My point was that it's mostly these kind of idiots that are willing to to just randomly dump a clip into a doordash driver that are buying those products. It's not a good thing that these companies are monitoring all of your activities, but it's not a bad thing when they catch scumbags like this.

4610	mvmg6hs	I got two answers for your question:\n\n1. The ghosting is really bad in 30 fps modes because games use temporal methods for upscaling, anti-aliasing, and denoising for RT. The artifacts caused by these algorithms are more apparent at lower frame rates because frames are on screen much longer and the amount of time for new frames to be drawn and for new information to be fed to the algorithm is much longer.\n\n2. The change in display technologies being used had a major impact on what most people would consider playable. CRTs are what were used by most people for a long time and they had pretty low input lag so 30 fps felt fine. However, now most people are using some variant of an LCD as their TV or monitor and they have much higher input lag compared to CRTs so 30 fps just isn't good enough anymore for a lot of game types.	spark_1230	1	2025-06-02 17:31:45	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmajcy	t3_1l1mxmr	2025-06-02 17:31:58.722987

4666	mvmgpai	I love souls games. I'm on NG+ with Lies of P now. Love that game. I was excited for E33, too, and got it pretty quickly which I normally don't do. I'm 12 hours in, and quit. \n\nThis is the most frustrating game I've ever played. I love the story, music, and art design, but not the exploration and combat. The parry aspect seemed fun for a turn-based game, but the way it's done is maddening. All I've done in Act 2 is die. I was avoiding enemy encounters when exploring because I didn't want the stress, and the overworld is a slog to navigate. Didn't touch any of the mini games. And all the stuff you have to manage ‚Äì pictos, lumina, weapon upgrades, stats,etc ‚Äì is a headache. Didn't feel that way about any souls game.\n\nI want to give it another try, though, in a few months. Maybe it's a mindset thing. Maybe this game just isn't my speed. It's not a bad one, and I love challenging combat, but I'm not currently enjoying the "getting gud" routine here. It's not the kind of frustrating I feel like powering through.	antisorceress	1	2025-06-02 17:34:11	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1knx6mh	t3_1knx6mh	2025-06-02 17:34:29.527141

To stop an advanced country that already has nuclear power from developing nuclear weapons could take significant military effort and intervention, and most countries wouldn't likely wouldn't favor the US attempting to play world police and invalidating the autonomy of advanced nations. It's an absolutely fine line to walk. But especially as the US is becoming an erratic and unreliable ally other countries that have utilized us an atomic shield might be more inclined to develop their own weapons in an attempt to ensure defence from invasion now that we aren't trustworthy to maintain that defense for them.	420yoloswagblazeit	1	2025-06-02 17:36:18	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmcrds	t3_1l1ja5y	2025-06-02 17:36:32.121123

4849	mvmimvz	Piggying off this statement and in no way is this directed at you but the people blaming UE5 for stuttering.\n\n\nAs a developer I understand the SDLC, engines, frameworks, libraries, etc. I‚Äôve been saying it for the longest time, UE5 isn‚Äôt the issue, it‚Äôs that devs develop games past the scope of the engines capabilities. Stuttering, poor performance, etc are additional effort that these devs need to take and modify the source engine so it fits their business requirements.\n\n\nUE5 isn‚Äôt the only engine that devs have developed past the scope, it‚Äôs just amplified because it‚Äôs becoming industry standard. RE engine and MHW for example is developing a game in an engine past its scope. It was made for Resident Evil 7 which has a relatively small map. Texture popping is a horrible issue in MHW that is largely contributed to the fact the engine wasn‚Äôt intended for a large open map. \n\n\nFrostbite engine was used for making Anthem and it was a loading screen simulator because the games maps were so large but you really only interacted with so much. It felt unnecessary to load that often.\n\n\nPoint I‚Äôm getting across is stop acting like UE5 is a unique engine that has unique issues and the fix is to stop using UE5. The fix is for game developers to spend more time and actually learn the ins and outs of UE5 so they can properly tailor it. If it‚Äôs going to be your engine of choice for decades then there‚Äôs no excuse. What you learn now will benefit you a decade from now.  \n\nA large part of the internet is developed using Angular, vue, or reactjs. You don‚Äôt go to a website and know what uses what but you definitely know which performs terribly. The truth is you can develop anything in any of them and get poor performance. You don‚Äôt blame the framework/library, you blame the developer for not taking additional steps to prevent poor performance.

4850	mvmip43	I'm not at all an expert in Trademark law, but I would assume they might have a hard time doing that, because other off-brands put more effort into differentiating themselves (at least a little bit).\n\nFor example, [Walmart Brand Oreos](https://i5.walmartimages.com/seo/Great-Value-Twist-Shout-Chocolate-Flavor-Sandwich-Cookies-14-3-oz_01fb5c0d-b10a-471b-920e-60f92a05acdf.c7768df5e21328a2f65022c2f5bdbdcb.jpeg), while looking similar, clearly have some differences. The Aldi ones, use the same Solid, blue background, where-as the walmart ones have this alternating light blue and dark blue pattern, as well as things like the cookies being in completely different spot, angled differently, and are called "Twist and Shout", which isn't at all confusing with "OREO" and uses a very different font.\n\nCompare that to Aldi, where they use the almost EXACT same blue background, the cookies are placed in almost the exact spot on the packaging with the almost same angle, the font is almost the exact same as the oreo font, the use the same big Capital "O" that Oreo uses to say "Original", as well as even having the same "Blue border with white inside" color for the font.\n\nSome of this might sound stupid or nitpicky, but they're all very real things that are considered in trademark law (Colors, fonts, packaging, etc.) and it feels like these Aldi ones are WAY closer to the name brand ones, then something like Great Value, which is likely why they can challenge this brand, but don't go after places like Walmart, or Target, who are doing the exact same thing, but do seemingly take more effort to differentiate their product from the name brand.	iTzGiR	1	2025-06-02 17:43:21	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvlnqv8	t3_1l1i9if	2025-06-02 17:43:35.967357

4855	mvmiqvf	>Trademark law only prevents people from actually confusing customers by presenting themselves as you. It doesn't protect you from someone making an identical cookie, labeling it different, and saying "hey, we have cookies like theirs, but at half the price", not as long as you're clear that you're a different company, not endorsed by them, etc.\n\nThat's exactly what commentors are pointing out above - Aldi isn't making their own cookie, labelling it differently, and saying, "hey, we have cookies like theirs, but at half the price".\n\nAldi is specifically aping the same size, color, style, and layout of name brand packaging so that customers can immediately recognize their store brand products as a copy of the original. They're riding the coattails of another brand to shortcut the effort they'd need to put in selling their own goods on their own merits with their own original designs.

It‚Äôs frankly disgusting,‚Äù said coach Andrew Mainini.\n\n>The high school junior was arrested when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pulled over a car full of students, according to multiple reports. The boys were on their way to an early Saturday morning volleyball practice; Mainini told [Boston.com](http://Boston.com) mhe initially thought they overslept.\n\n>But, one of the student athletes texted Mainini, letting him know that the driver of their carpool had been detained by federal agents. The coach learned more details from the students Sunday, who said that upwards of **ten masked people, who appeared to be ICE agents, began questioning the three high schoolers and scanning their faces with cell phones on their way to practice.**\n\n>‚ÄúThese are high school students. They‚Äôre honors and AP level students. They are members of athletic teams. They are members of the student council. They are members of the school musical ensembles,‚Äù Mainini said.\n\n>Sunday morning, Milford families celebrated during the high school‚Äôs graduation ceremony. Afterwards, community members gathered to support the detained student at Milford Town Hall. The town, which is about 40 miles southwest of Boston, is nearly 30 percent foreign-born, according to census data.\n\nThe Gestapo is targeting school buses.

It isn‚Äôt always about the shooter suing them, the opposite can sometimes happen.\n\nThey put out a story saying X murdered Y. This claim is not proven in court yet. X‚Äôs lawyer comes out saying that due to the widespread news claiming that X indeed murdered Y (and murder has a very specific legal definition), that the jury is tainted. Finding an ‚Äúimpartial jury‚Äù now becomes a huge hassle. In the end, X doesn‚Äôt get convicted due to judicial procedure related issues. Y‚Äôs estate now sues news outlet for damages saying that their news coverage resulted in the estate being unable to recoup costs.\n\nThe legal system is filled with a lot of procedural loopholes like this, because they‚Äôre designed to ensure that innocent people cannot easily be railroaded into a magical guilty charge - which is also why prosecutors push so hard to settle. They intimidate the defendant with the risk of a long, expensive trial - so even if they‚Äôd eventually be cleared of charges, it might take a lot of time and effort. It‚Äôs easy to sue in civil court for damages, especially because civil suits do not have 5th amendment protections in the same way as criminal court (refusing to answer questions in civil court *can* be used to suggest culpability), and you only really have to prove damages. \n\n\nAt the end of the day, realistically, many of these things likely wouldn‚Äôt happen - but they *could*, especially when the victim is someone famous, so news outlets would rather just not take the risk	kuroimakina	1	2025-06-02 17:45:07	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm2huh	t3_1l1mfld	2025-06-02 17:45:18.292355

4991	mvmk9zq	You're not wrong about the discrimination and intolerance. We just have to accept the unfortunate reality that some people have very different views on what is morally and socially acceptable in a society. It only works if both sides work together the best they can, otherwise, history tells us it almost always ends in war and violence.   \n  \nIt is disappointing to me and also makes me sad that these are the options we have politically, but we have to play with the cards we're dealt.\n\nI don't think majority of people in Poland who voted are full of hate and prejudice. I'm sure some are, and I'm sure some are willing to overlook certain things as long their candidate acts in their own self interests. Others may simply be ignorant or misinformed. I don't know what's going through millions of peoples thoughts.   \n  \nI agree about the bare minimum requirements. I believe that is the essence of a democratic and free nation, but the definition of **however they want** varies between people. Some people consider things we have freedom to do as crimes that should be illegal, others believe things that are illegal (like certain drugs for example), should be part of that freedom.   \n  \nThings seemed to work in the western world, but the west also participated in the dismantling and destruction of many middle eastern nations. Justified or not is a separate discussion. I don't know what the right path forward for us is, but I do appreciate your civil replies.	skylinx	1	2025-06-02 17:50:35	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm92i3	t3_1l19pj3	2025-06-02 17:50:50.937085

I‚Äôve never been so excited to explode into space dust.\n\nThe pixel art is gorgeous, the sound design is crisp, and the UI is clean. No bloat, no fluff‚Äîjust pure, unfiltered fun. I have no idea how this isn't blowing up everywhere already. This is *the* sleeper hit of the year. Ryan & Jakob absolutely cooked.

If they would be cooking for 5 more years, they wouldn't have any of this feedback because no one would be doing games in it.\n\nUnreal Engine was always future proof tool or at least "fix it as stuff are happening" type of tool.

For a supposedly "niche" genre that is a hell of a number.\n\n\nDo the same thing with Souls-like and you get 1261 action games with Souls-like tag and 18953 games without. Its like 6%.\n\n\nActual numbers for rogue searches (again, limited to 2024 and newer):\n\n\nNumber of action games without rogue elements: 16906\n\nNumber of action roguelike: 3008\n\nNumber of action roguelite: 2999\n\nNumber of action that have both like & lite tag: 2012, so substracting those from the total we get 3995 games that have either or both tags\n\n\nThat is 23.6% of all action games made since 2024 that are tagged as rogue-something.\n\n\nNow, add to that the fact Souls-like IS indeed a common mislabel (anything difficult can get it), but rogue is not misapplied to games often.\n\n\nTell me again, how are we not flooded in rogue games?

They might sponsor NASCAR, buy millions in TV, more millions in Google Ads, and millions in print ads. \n\nKnock-off brands have none of that expense. \n\nProduction costs are a fraction of the total cost of a product like Oreos. This is why the largest companies make knock-offs, sell just a bit less than the dominant brand, and then pocket the big profits.	lolas_coffee	1	2025-06-02 17:55:49	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvl6t4m	t3_1l1i9if	2025-06-02 17:55:59.981056

5128	mvmlx6f	PiS have been openly flaunting anti-eu rhetorics and lashing out eu representatives and institutions. It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôll leave EU, on the opposite, their attitude is take everything contribute nothing, like Hungary. We know how much of a problem Hungary is. Plus they heavily align themselves with the US and criticise current government militarisation plans. Their idea is to keep increasing dependency on the States, which in times when trump openly opposes European countries and considers restoring trade with russia is both stupid and dangerous.\n\nNon-alignment is only possible when all sides are supporting it.

5131	mvmlyld	When Reagan and congressional Republicans scrapped the Mental Health Systems Act and turned its funds into flexible block grants, states almost immediately shifted that money away from community programs‚Äîleaving people with serious mental illnesses without affordable treatment, housing, or support. This led to a huge wave of deinstitutionalization with no real safety net, pushing thousands into homelessness, emergency rooms, and jails that couldn‚Äôt help them. \n\nDecades later, the lack of early intervention and ongoing care has only made things worse, driving up violent encounters and public crises as untreated mental illness turns desperation into tragedy.

But the Prosecutor/DA clearly wasn't confident enough to the point they let the guy off, and shined his knob for him on the way out.\n\nThat also said, respected member as i said before is just glazing. The key component is he was (supposedly) a member of society with no criminal history. Save something like Capital murder, you always get a very lenient sentence for your first offense.

5171	mvmmgv5	There has been some research on what actually causes gun violence. It isn't really lack of access to jobs or education, nor is it the existence of criminals harming others to commit robberies or other crimes: it is people with access to guns getting angry and impulsively killing others. Here is a good Planet Money on the topic: [https://www.npr.org/2025/05/14/1251284819/us-gun-violence-and-behavioral-economics](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/14/1251284819/us-gun-violence-and-behavioral-economics)\n\nIt also turns out, that this is also the reason for suicide prevalence: impulsivity + access to means.	itijara	1	2025-06-02 18:00:40	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm4mds	t3_1l1mfld	2025-06-02 18:00:52.124553

Steam just has a hard time becoming the monopoly they are on Windows due to Apple already filling that space themselves with their walled garden approach. \n\nThis is why using a Steam hardware survey to determine OS usage is misleading, it only counts those who actively use Steam on a regular basis. Just like Steam player statistics won't account for GamePass and console players.\n\nApple's push for gaming is heavily focussed on games releasing in their own storefronts (App Store and Apple Arcade), where people have existing libraries. Just like on Windows people were hestitant to switch to the Epic Store due to having large pre-existing libraries in Steam.

5207	mvmn2e7	This is a complex topic; but in short:\n\nFor a half-century, America has been implementing a neoliberal economic agenda.\n\nThis was sold to the public as a way to end the stagflation crisis of the ‚Äò70s, and grow the economy.\n\nMainly, it has resulted in the upwards transfer of wealth; where more and more of the money you, I, and everyone else earn ends up in the hands of the 1%.\n\nThe average American might not be aware of this phenomenon; but they are very aware of how their financial security is being affected. Their costs are shooting up, and their wages are still the same.\n\nIt used to be that 30% of Americans were one missed paycheck away from financial disaster. Now it is *60%.*\n\n*They want change.*\n\nThe next problem is the Democratic Party - that is to say, the organization that chooses candidates to run for office, funds their campaigns, etc.\n\nThe organization itself is (or was, at least until recently) controlled by a small group of people that were very close with wealthy donors that benefitted from neoliberal economic policy.\n\nThese people exerted their influence on the party; which in turn meant that a lot of the Democrat politicians that were elected also tended to be in favor of these economic policies.\n\nAnd that really sucks, because *people want change.*\n\nThe Republican party is also composed of people that favor neoliberal economic policies; in fact, more so. Which means there won‚Äôt be any change there, either.\n\nBut also: unlike the Democrats, they have zero compunction when it comes to playing dirty. They lie about their motives; they give the American public easy scapegoats (such as immigrants and trans people) to blame.\n\nThe Republicans also benefit from an enormous conservative propaganda machine in the form of Fox News and its ilk; and the two defenses against propaganda - traditional journalism, and good education - have both been defanged by the Republicans.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nThis is what brings is to the present:\n\nPeople want change.\n\nThe Democrats can‚Äôt deliver change without abandoning their donors.\n\nThe Republicans won‚Äôt deliver change (and will in fact make things worse); but they are very good at lying about delivering change.\n\nThen their media empire backs them up; and the average American is woefully ill-equipped to determine that they are being lied to.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nThe solution is a raft of truly left-wing candidates, delivering actual, major changes. (Taxing the wealthy, Medicare For All, increasing the social safety net, etc.)\n\nWhether or not that happens depends on whether the existing Democrat kingmakers will get out of the way; and if those candidates can survive the inevitable character assassination attempts of conservative media.	waffebunny	1	2025-06-02 18:03:31	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvjc9eq	t3_1l0ghe0	2025-06-02 18:03:41.978229

5218	mvmn9oi	Only tangentially related, but I remember when Spider-Man Homecoming came out, there was a lot of online discourse about the "retcon" of Peter Parker now being super into Star Wars, after that comment in Civil War.\n\nBut, as someone who was the same age as Peter Parker when that movie came out, I never saw that as a change of character at all because I could *absolutely* see myself referencing Star Wars as "that really old movie" when surrounded by adults to jokingly try to make everyone feel old.\n\nThat type of thing is sarcastic, but I think it comes from a place of genuine respect and excitement for older cultural icons.

If and when unemployment is driven through the roof as AI and automation replace humans, all of the money that used to be paid out as salaries will funnel even further up. UBI is just a redistribution mechanism. If it's not driving up household income, due to loss of high-paying jobs, it won't drive up inflation. It's meant as replacement income, not supplemental.

5314	mvmobd3	Bringing manufacturing back isn‚Äôt about nostalgia, it‚Äôs about rebuilding a stable, high-paying job base that doesn‚Äôt require a college degree. According to the **Reshoring Initiative**, nearly **2 million jobs** have been brought back since 2010 through reshoring and foreign direct investment. ([Reshoring Initiative, 2023 Report](https://reshoringinstitute.org/white-paper-minimum-wages-and-reshoring/))\n\nManufacturing jobs historically anchored the middle class ‚Äî their decline correlates with the erosion of economic security across working communities. A **Time Magazine** analysis found that over a third of U.S. manufacturing workers now rely on public assistance, highlighting the consequences of low-wage, outsourced labor. ([Time, ‚ÄúThe Myth and Reality of Manufacturing in America,‚Äù 2016]())\n\nWages won‚Äôt spike overnight, and prices might not drop immediately ‚Äî but long-term, domestic production builds economic **resilience**, improves supply chain stability, and gives us more control. (Brookings:[Reshoring advanced manufacturing supply chains to generate good jobs](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/reshoring-advanced-manufacturing-supply-chains-to-generate-good-jobs/))\n\nAs for Nvidia and others ‚Äúwaiting it out‚Äù ‚Äî the **CHIPS and Science Act** has **bipartisan** support. Companies are investing in U.S. fabs *now*, because the risks of overseas dependence (like with Taiwan) aren‚Äôt political‚Äîthey‚Äôre strategic. Considering China's inability to produce advanced chips at scale, combined with their plummeting demographics and aging workforce making an invasion of Taiwan very likely, and it's clear that whomever is at the head (MAGA or not), American manufacturing is imperative, not idealistic.

5407	mvmpebs	The odd thing is, 12 had a combat system very similar to 13, but people always say how good 12 is and bad 13 was. In 12 all you do is move your character around and then you can program a decision tree for their actions. It's not that different from 13 where 99% of what you're doing is switching characters between job classes.\n\nFF12 also had a completely impenetrable plot. I've played that through like 3 times and still can barely make sense of even the basic plot. Big evil empire invades small neighbor country, and the deposed princess of the small country sets off on a journey with a ragtag group of followers to.... do something. Then the game just sort of ends abruptly to set up the DS sequel most people probably never even knew existed.

It‚Äôs tragic, but we can‚Äôt say for sure what happened legally beyond there was a dispute and one of them is now sadly no longer alive. It would be irresponsible for journalists to say more than that at this time, and there are cases where the media has taken it upon themselves to make accusations that have ruined people‚Äôs lives.

And their government were so hardline on supporting Ukraine to win the war, that many people around here were afraid that they were searching for an excuse to trigger article 5. \n\nFor years PIS had criticised in very harsh terms Germany for fueling with Euros the Russian economy through the Nord-Stream pipelines and whenever there was talk of sending a new round of weapons to the Ukrainians, it wasn't the "EU leaders" militating for it. Olaf Schulz was sabotaging any discussion of supporting Ukraine and Macron, while having a very strong rhetoric, at the end of the day was only sending good wishes and prayers. It was Poland that stept in on every single occasion for Ukraine to obtain the weapons they needed and Poland was at the time governed by PIS.

All that can be said legally at this time is that a dispute occurred and one of them is sadly no longer alive. We can‚Äôt say what the exact chain of events was that led to this.

5528	mvmqv71	If that's the guy from Pennsylvania a few years back, he didn't snap because he lost an argument. The couple were throwing snow across the street from their driveway into his and had been harassing him for years. Even when his wife died of cancer, they made jokes about that too. They were threatening him, threw things at him, and tried to punch him when he confronted them about throwing snow into his driveway. He warned them he was going to get his gun, and they egged him on when he pointed it at them and told them to leave. After the whole ordeal he went inside and shot himself too.\n\nNone of that is an excuse for murder but the couple he killed were far from saints and were warned multiple times.	mc_nugget_buddy	1	2025-06-02 18:21:40	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmgks9	t3_1l1mfld	2025-06-02 18:21:51.946578
5529	mvmqvis	In sports games (I'm talking the NHL series specifically) player likenesses, and hair actually flowing from under the helmet. \n\nIn a more general sense, I hate when a game has you finding different weapons and outfits but then when a cutscene happens the weapon defaults to something specific or the armor changes to something else. \n\nLip syncing is STILL not consistent in a lot of games. I'll never understand that. By this point it should be standard and easy for lipsyncing to be correct. More nit picky, when a game has a different dialog option but the lipsyncing only matches English. Best example I can give is Ghost of Tsushima or AC Shadows. Both games had a more authentic option for the language spoken and yet when I chose that the lip syncing was for english still. So dumb.\n\nhere's a nit picky one: sleeping. In games where you sleep and they show the character lay down, they always just lay flat on the bed right on top of the covers and never adjust to get comfortable. that's annoying lol.

Too bad because if you‚Äôre good you get the much better ending AND the game will still reward you with tons of ADAM‚Ä¶.you just need to wait.\n\nBoth Infamous games (especially 2) would lock really cool abilities for going fully on the good/evil route. Problem is that either none of this matters to the overall plot (infamous 1) or the evil plot is really weak (Infamous 2).\n\nInfamous 2 is really annoying because the evil powers are sooooo much more fun than the ‚Äúgood‚Äù abilities but the story takes a nosedive for going that route.

5583	mvmrmsu	Devs like Larian and Sandfall are highlighting that they don't NEED to charge $70+ to make it work - these publishers are choosing to charge that much because they think they can force the market to accept it. It's not a necessity, it's inefficiency. When you have rampant dev bloat and exorbitant exec salaries while the actual devs are being ground down in the process, it's a problem of greed and mismanagement.\n\nThat's why AAA devs and publishers were trying to downplay and handwave the success of BG3 and E33. They highlight this for the industry to take notice.\n\nAs a crusty old turn-based RPG fan, I also love that E33 is debunking the "turn-based RPGs are dead" narrative. They're not dead, they just have to innovate. I feel like this is where Square is giving up and/or failing (FF7R comes close, but still feels weird to me) while E33 somehow made it feel like traditional turn-based RPG mechanics...with added layers and active aspects that make it more "modern" to a less patient world of gamers who would otherwise be too twitchy for turn-based RPGs.

5586	mvmrnme	Because you over simplified it. It‚Äôs not that easy\n\nYes they made a thing and another thing. Cloth simulations are quite intensive on hardware I believe, that‚Äôs why you can often turn them off in graphics settings.\n\nAll for a cape to hang down on someone and flap in the wind or when moving,, you‚Äôre suddenly computing wind, and gravity, and drag and resistance on the material or body on the things it‚Äôs attached to. Is this cape able to interact with other parts of the game. If you change the clothing of the character, like big spiked shoulder pads, it now needs to change for that. Does this mean that shoulder pads are part of the hit box. Are these a real tangible thing in the world. Or just a skin for the character. You see how it escalates.

(Elitism is the name of the game)\n\nSingle player games with cult following > "You're playing the game wrong", "That's cheating", "That mod is racist/lame/sexist/trash/____"\n\n\nWhat I've found is that the best experience I ever had with other "gamers" is playing a not so popular MMO and not interracting with communities around popular  games.\n\nThe more complex a game is, the more it repels destructive people.

5624	mvms3cd	Hmm, yes and no. I have a lot of experience with the game, I have 150 hours in it, I've 100% all achievements, done all the speed runs and challenges etc. \n\nThat being said, some of the very hardest fights in the entire game are in the beginning. So it's easy to feel powerless, especially as you're still mastering the controls. Not to say the later parts of the game are easier tho, and there are a few genuine horror sections later in the game too.\n\nI think the big difference is the original RE4 is a lot more lighthearted and campy by comparison. The new one is a bit darker, more serious, and because of that has an overall heavier tone and scarier encounters. In my opinion at least.	trio3224	1	2025-06-02 18:27:34	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmaakh	t3_1l0sdcf	2025-06-02 18:27:53.865463

5649	mvmsb1b	Sure, but there's also legitimate fear among Jews that antisemitism isn't being taken seriously enough, and threats to Jewish lives aren't being taken seriously enough, and whether or not one supports the current leadership in Israel, the narrative has begun to include blatantly antisemitic beliefs and normative claims about what is to be done with Israel, which, when pointed out, are denied, as if it's just legitimate criticism of the government in Israel to suggest that there shouldn't exist a state called "Israel", part of the aim of which is to ensure that Jews have a way to protect themselves against antisemitism on their own terms.\n\nIt has been said so many times, even by many Jews themselves: why does Israel need to exist? Jews could just live anywhere in the West and be fine!\n\nWell, as convincing as that might sometimes seem, it's events like this current one that serve as evidence for Jews who do not believe they will ever be truly safe in any country that isn't majority Jewish.\n\nDetails can be quibbled over, but... this does seem to be the way things stand.

5650	mvmscio	Sure, but then wouldn't the expectation be that the usage would be reversed? The "aired" version usually is what is having to reduce runtime, but you're showing that they chose the longer one for the aired. Also feels like substituting individual words would be absolute last resort because the difference is so small compared to just cutting out entire lines (which they did a lot of). Like if they're looking to get the runtime in check this choice is going to move the needle towards that very little. I'm no editor though.\n\nBut all in all I think you'd need to compare the scenes side by side to see the actual difference. There may have been other differences in how quickly he spoke the words, sentence structure, etc. I no longer have the aired version so I can't check this easily.	lituus	1	2025-06-02 18:28:49	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmpzi8	t3_1l1mfld	2025-06-02 18:29:06.468497

5689	mvmswls	HDR mostly works. Mostly in that the desktop works but some games just refuse.\n\nMost of the time--that is, except for some old games--you just enable a proton version in steam settings for everything (plus maybe background vulkan processing) and it works. So it's checking an option in a settings menu.\n\nHonestly, most people aren't going to really know what Linux daily will be like for them unless they do it. I realize a new hard drive can be more expensive than most people would want, but if you can afford one, just buy it and install something like bazzite and dual boot for a while. If you basically don't log onto Windows, you can move off it. Otherwise, you can format the drive and just use it for Windows. If you have a spare "Games" drive anyway, you can use that. \n\nIf you feel confident, you can partition a drive you already have.	rrtk77	1	2025-06-02 18:31:32	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmnhu1	t3_1l1dhda	2025-06-02 18:31:42.913104

5712	mvmt63o	A large part of what the framework gives however is structure to do things quickly. There definitely can be cases where your business requirement requires a process to be done differently than how the framework provides, but that‚Äôs why the open-source or source available (unreal engine) becomes important and you‚Äôre given freedom to tailor it as needed. \n\n\nIf for 90% of the job is done more quickly because of how Unreal enables you, but the 10% requires additional effort then you have saved enough time to work on that extra 10%.\n\n\nLargely it‚Äôs management and/or executives faults in game development for not spending that extra time because they see the saved time as cost saving or in another word, profit. I typically don‚Äôt really blame the devs themselves as it‚Äôs usually due to the people above them but gamers don‚Äôt understand that.

5776	mvmu0vg	The term "roguelike" does not mean what it used to mean. Nowadays it means any game with random elements and a game loop of repeated runs to see how far you can get each time. If you unlock permanent upgrades outside of runs, people say "roguelite".\n\n\nThis is just the standard arcade game formula that has existed for like 50 years. Compare to pinball, or Pacman for example. You start fresh each time, fight your way through the chaos, eventually lose and start over.

5789	mvmu43w	>Graphics drivers are more stable\n\nI wish this were true. The reality is that graphics drivers on Linux are more stable. But the reason you think that isn't true is due to the fact that you use consumer cards and companies line Nvidia don't give you the driver support you deserve. \n\nWe have had graphics cards supported for Linux/Unix directly from Nvidia with Nvidia GRID (and other platforms from them). This support is rock solid and has effectively zero issues. However, they don't give this out to everyone. Nor do they give out the same support to their non-enterprise GPUs. \n\nAnd to be clear, updates to graphics drivers sounds like a good thing on the surface. But realistically these updates commonly cause major issues. I usually stay 2 versions back and skip problem versions and have no issues.

The philosopher Buber in I and Thou asked us to see the other as a human being and treat other with respect instead of an "it", an object.\nAs a french, I ve received slurs and even threats online in the past solely because of my nationality, other nationalities get the same treatment, if people want to DM me to call me dirty french again you re not gonna be original nor hurt me.\n\n\nThe og comment itself say that france is inferior and french people are inferior I call that discrimination and hate speech.¬†\nI ve seen 0 argument as to why french culture is inferior, 0 artist dropped, while I m the only one talking about cultureS, like any racist take on the internet nothing to back up the claims.\n\n\nIt shares the same flawed reasoning that sexists are using against women, I m being objectified, not my own person anymore I don't have any culture I'm only seen as my nationality, it's discrimination\n\n\nThe og comment "I dislike [X NATIONALITY], others are superior" from the beginning a fact appears without proof\nThen, "[X country] is the worst, it has the worst people" now having a nationality is enough to be not just inferior to others but the worst kind of person\nThen it transforms into: I don't want to deal with you and your X Nationality-attitude (so I m not my own person, I'm objectified, instead of my own personality I have instead The french personality, the french attitude that they all share and can be reduced to it)\nWe can replace [X] by women\n=> I dislike women, men are superior\nWomen are the worst, everything about them is the worst thing I ve experienced\nI don't care about anything related to women, and I don't want your woman attitude, Good bye end of discussion I won't ever back up my claims and give arguments nor engage in a discussion with a woman\n\n\n\n\nThe exact thing sexists are saying, the racist takes are the same as the sexists takes\nNo matter what a woman/XNationality does or thinks or says in the end there are a woman/XNationality¬†\nand woman/XNationality = wrong\n\n\nWhy do people support this kind of reasoning ?¬†\nI don't think people are inferior to others based on a nationality, something they can't even decide	ErikiFurudi	1	2025-06-02 18:40:57	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvdlmww	t3_1kz174g	2025-06-02 18:41:08.201671

5857	mvmuxke	If you ever look at pro settings for shooters you'll find dpis usually around 400-800.  1600 becomes more common when you expand out the genres.  But 16,000?  That's for when you have multiple 8k screens.  Pretty much all the people I talk to find 1600-2000 to be the most comfortable for desktop use and just leave it at that for everything.  Warframe is the only game I can remember off the top of my head where getting a good sensitivity was a giant pain because i had to stick to the tiniest numbers on a scale that went to 100, and it's not even that old.  6500 dpi mice were out when it was new.

5906	mvmvkxh	AI. I feel like we are regressing in the AI sphere of development. IMO, AI in many games seem completely broken or non-existent. And I don't mean AI being artificially difficult by just making them have borderline cheating behavior. I mean AI that is actually smart, makes coherent and sensible decisions. Look at the Total War games where the AI are pretty brain dead, especially in defensive/siege warfare and general troop management and maneuvers. The AI in those games haven't really progressed much since the earlier TW games of the mid to late 2000's era of TW. The only game that I can think of that has pretty reasonable AI is Ready Or Not. The AI in that game tries everything in its power to deceive you at times and actually pulls off some pretty smart behavior from time to time.

I'm not generally supportive of AI in gaming, but I think this could be an interesting implementation of it for quest generation/world building.

It takes far more development time to do baked lighting than it is to have Ray Traced Global Illumination or Path Tracing. It also has the benefits of making lighting look more realistic. \n\nPeople thought the same about 3D accelerators and look where we are now.

5960	mvmwdsx	What an absolutely idiotic and an ignorant thing to copy and paste.\n\nWhen there is no innovation, people complain about lazy and creatively bankrupt developers who just sell the same thing over and over, as well as outdated consoles that hold back games.\n\nWhen innovation finally happens and graphics truly evolve, people complain about "forced" ray tracing because "they" want to sell more GPUs.\n\nDisgusting hypocrites.\n\nPeople who think real-time ray tracing is a gimmick have no idea what they're talking about, plain and simple. Until not too long ago, you had to leave lighting to render overnight, now it happens in real time at 60 FPS and above in the latest and the most complex games, not just in some tech demos. The difference in lighting quality is night and day, not to mention the process of making lighting being infinitely simpler since you don't have to manually recreate an impression of realistic lighting, instead it genuinely is realistic lighting just like that.

I'd love to see raytracing used for more than just visual effects as well. It could be used to create a more immersive soundscape where sounds keyed to the position of your character, not just a sort of approximation from the devs. \n\nFor the immediate term though, I'm much more interested in DolbyVision for games.

6119	mvmylrh	It is a cut and dry answer though.. Without independent graphics processors we would never have seen the jump we did. And the rise in cost to absurd numbers is rather recent. The problem isn't the way the tech was implemented, but rather the amount of people actually in the know that want a graphics card. Capitalism fueled consumerism means everyone wants the latest and greatest. Companies can charge for that, and silicon isn't getting any cheaper. You don't need a $2000 gpu to play great video games, and with modern APU's you can actually play a good majority of them on integrated graphics in 2025.

I can't count the number of times I wished I could reach into the screen and strangle the annoying AF whiny little bitch Hope. Snow was a bit over the top too.\n\nNot trying to shoot the messenger or anything, but trying to compare 12 to Star Wars is a really bad comparison. There are some superficial similarities, but that's it. And the Star Wars plot was rather thin and basic, but it was at least comprehensible. The plot to 12 is just all over the place.

6155	mvmz2pl	I use to work at jobcorps. It is an amazing program. It is a lifeline for many teens and young adults looking to escape poverty. It allows younger teens and adults to get their GED and learn a trade for free. It provides free housing and is like a small college with dorms and shit. Seeing this breaks my heart. So many of those students are going to end up on the streets and shelters cuz they have no where else to go. I saw it first hand during Covid when we had to close down the center. I had so many students crying and begging to stay cuz they had no where to go or had to go back to abusive homes. That was the worst week of my career. I cried myself to sleep every night knowing that many of the students would end up homeless and living on the streets. I loved my students and went above and beyond to help them. I knew almost every student by name and built up their trust. Students were comfortable reaching out to me when they were in crisis or struggling. \n\nJobcorps is a lifeline for many teens and young adults looking to escape poverty, get their education, and learn a trade. I honestly think job corps is one of the best government programs we have. I have watched so many students go from getting kicked out of every high school,living on the streets, and being gang members to turning their life around and become successful. It gives teens and young adults who can‚Äôt afford school to get their GED and learn a trade. This program helps so many youth escape poverty and make a life for themselves. This is going to fuck over so many people. Fuck Trump and fuck this administration. \n\nI‚Äôm not religious but I‚Äôll be praying for all the students, teens, and young adults this will affect as I cry myself to sleep tonight.	slytherinwitchbitch	1	2025-06-02 19:00:56	news	f	\N	\N	t3_1kzbb2r	t3_1kzbb2r	2025-06-02 19:01:09.850108

6157	mvmz3e1	No, it will not. PC gaming is just going through some growing pains with raytracing, but growing pains are nothing new in the PC industry. Before this, we've had to upgrade from software rendering to dedicated 3D accelerator cards. Then there was another major upgrade for programmable shaders. We've been fine through each. Technology just progresses and we adapt.\n\nIt's stupid to fault developers for using raytracing and other new technologies. They're just doing their jobs and improving graphical fidelity, as they freaking should.\n\nYou want someone to blame? Blame GPU manufacturers and the current political and economic conditions that have forced the production of such important hardware to be concentrated into the hands of just a few companies. Hating on devs for using a technology is just advocating for progress to be stifled.\n\nPut the blame and hate on the right people instead of id who have arguably created the most efficient game engine and RT implementation out of any game currently on the market.

6161	mvmz4j9	Eh, many holes in your theory that you state as fact.\n\nFirst, the system to deal with mentally ill people was broken long before Reagan and is not a Red vs Blue thing. A major cultural touchstone on the issue 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' was published in 1962 and set in the Oregon. Turns out things have been fucked decades before Reagan and including liberal coastal states.\n\nAlso, other than cities that willingly tolerated homelessness like LA and Portland, overall most areas improved on the visible effects of homelessness, mental illness and drug/crime from the early 80s until around the pandemic. We could even say 2015. That was with multiple recessions on housing bubbles/bursts... \n\nSo why is it so bad now? It's complex, but to leave out opioids as a major factor shows you don't really want to have a serious conversation on the root causes and possible solutions.	running_wired	1	2025-06-02 19:01:11	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmlyld	t3_1l1omat	2025-06-02 19:01:26.899469

This ebbs and flows and gives us a number close to 120 million active accounts over the course of a day. \n\nSo with the knowledge of 120 million active users a day that comes to about 600k new Linux users on the platform. Of course, not everyone participates in the survey, so if we cut that number down by 50%  that is still 300k new Linux users in the course of a month. \n\nCall it funny, but data shows a clear increase and a higher move towards non-windows platforms.

So he figured his company's only goal should be to sell the best vanilla possible. \n\nOr, as James Stephanie Sterling would put it: "The Cunt-(**SKELETON WARRIORS!**)s don't just want to make *more* money, they want *all* the money!" By which, they mean that these executives want companies to focus solely on those things that seem to be the best sellers. \n\nThis is why you had EA claiming nobody wanted to play Single-Player games. In truth, they just found Multiplayer games sold better, so they only wanted to make Multiplayer games.

6216	mvn02fo	Oh boy, should I remind everyone about Pixel Shaders from around 2001 and forward era? They too solved a lot of rendering issues developer side and provided some fancy eye candy to players not possible before with any other technique and was not only required to be supported in hardware as there is no way of efficiently doing it in software, it was also immensely demanding. Fast forward and you cannot find a new game that isn't using Pixel Shaders.\n\nSituation is not really different for ray tracing and while there are some games that demand ray tracing capability in hardware, there is still a lot that only have it as optional. And there are some like Unreal Engine 5 based games that do ray tracing in "software". It's faster and not as detailed/denoised, but is physical ray tracing. Marvel Rivals and Oblivion Remastered use UE5's Lumen technology to do ray tracing on any graphic card.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with evolution of 3D graphics. What is wrong is when it's only NVIDIA's version and knowing NVIDIA's BS, it's always inflated and artificially degraded for competitor's products just to make them look better while not really being that better. They've done it with Pixel Shaders, they've done it with PhysX, they've done it with DLSS and they are doing with ray tracing. They artificially make it basically unusable for everyone else intentionally so you buy their hardware. They ruined physics in so many games just to shoehorn their hardware accelerated PhysX and make it look better even though we've had CPU run physics that looked and felt better for years prior.\n\nSo, yeah, RT is natural evolution and it's pretty cool we can do it in realtime now, the problem is proprietary crap from yours truly, NVIDIA. They are the real problem here. They specifically. Indiana Jones and Doom requiring ray tracing are not the evil here. Especially not Doom The Dark Ages which runs absolutely amazing on my Radeon (it's RX 9070 XT but still a Radeon). I don't have issues with games that run on anything and they put a lot of effort into running really well.

For individuals born in Sweden to two foreign-born parents, the relative risk increases to 3.2. A study analyzing convictions from 2000 to 2015 found that 59.2% of those convicted of rape or attempted rape had an immigrant background. Specifically, 47.7% were foreign-born, while 11.5% were born in Sweden to at least one foreign-born parent. So 27% of the population (immigrants) commit 59% of rape.

6407	mvn27gh	It's the same as with Coca-Cola. If you think that there's some "secret recipe" and that's why nobody has ever figured out how to make a knockoff Coca-Cola, you're wrong.\n\nThere are lots of people who work in food development who can copy a product exactly: taste, texture, performance. \n\nBut let's say you copy Coca-Cola. You'll have a product that tastes exactly like it. But people would still prefer Coca-Cola because yours is not Coca-Cola. It's as simple as that. People know Coca-Cola, they don't know your brand.\n\nStores like Aldi, Lidl etc. have their own knockoffs. But they can't charge the same price as the original product, because it's not the brand name. But they can still turn a profit, because they're not spending the money on marketing. \n\nAlso brand name products, like Oreos have dedicated production lines that crank out Oreos day in day out. \n\nStore products have the luxury of shopping around, finding the manufacturer that can make their product the cheapest. Today it might be produced in Ohio, tomorrow in Wisconsin. \n\nSo even if you find a person who says "I know a guy who works at the factory in Pennsylvania, and all they do is change the labels to run the store product." This may have been true at some point, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's true today.	dat_finn	1	2025-06-02 19:16:07	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvlrsly	t3_1l1i9if	2025-06-02 19:16:20.678901

Because in addition to the bunches of unjustified killings and brutalities that you see way too often, when it actually comes to for them to do their job against actually dangerous people a lot of times they just bitch the fuck out and try to do anything they can to avoid actually dealing with it because, you know, that would be difficult and potentially dangerous for them.\n\n\nI mean I guess it's good they dealt with the sex offender, but gee wonder why they dealt with him and not the guy who literally attempted murder twice and did time for being an accessory to one. Just serves to remind that most cops are not heroes but instead huge pussies who will try their hardest not to lift a finger to resolve any dispute that might put them in danger. Idk it's just infuriating, "protect and serve" my ass, most of the time the "protect" part actually just applies to themselves.

6589	mvn4cam	You can't just slap a "reusable gameplay" sticker on and call it a day, there's a lot of stuff that goes into making a decent roguelike experience.\n\nIt's just also really effective compared to the effort required.\n\nAlso the point of roguelike games is not getting to reuse the primary game loop, just about every game does that, it's that the way you use it makes it so new content is multiplied with the old content, whereas another game would only get to add it as an extension of old content.\n\nTL;DR: it's strange because it takes a lot of work to make roguelike experiences but the result is that new content gives so much more replayability than normal, not that old content can be reused.

6596	mvn4fg9	Open world destruction, I'd say the indie game Teardown comes as close as possible, it's designed around voxel graphics, to be a reverse Minecraft, everything is built to be completely destroyed. There isn't enough destruction in AAA gaming, Red Faction did have some cool destruction set pieces, but I'd love something that goes even further. I do get plenty of issues, like if GTA said you can demolish any building, players would have a permanent ghost town and it would get boring. \n\nBut ever since seeing The Blues Brothers movie as a kid, I've dreamed of a video game where you could have a car chase through a mall where you're destroying everything, breaking down walls, smashing kiosks, and nothing is off limits. GTA Vice City and Saints Row 2 had a car in the malls, but the most damage you could do was break glass windows. I want to take any car, crash into the front doors, and create a new exit when I'm done trashing the place. You could absolutely do this as a semi scripted story mission.	metalyger	1	2025-06-02 19:26:52	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1lzha	t3_1l1lzha	2025-06-02 19:27:05.763354

This was years ago, but I had gotten to the point where I just had to mute everyone who said something even slightly rude because if they say ONE thing early on, they are not gonna shut up the entire time to flame you, guaranteed.  And it sucks cause I would like to talk with people casually but people just stopped doing that and seemed to think trash talk was the only acceptable conversation topic.\n\nI've been dragged into playing a match or two since quitting, having everyone but my friends muted, but the results screen unmutes everyone and **every  single  match** would have someone going "Top diff" or "mid diff" or "supp diff" in the post game screen without fail.

We're understaffed, on a hiring freeze, and no one's getting raises, and a lot of benefits are being cut, which means more and more people are quitting. Funding is being cut on both a federal and state level, as well as medicare/medicaid reimburstment rates going down (which means we see less money for about 80% of our population).\n\nThis is just a thing everywhere, unless you don't mind going to a private practice, that won't ever cover medicare/medicaid (understandable with all the bullshit paperwork, requirements, the amount of teeth you have to pull to get them to do ANYTHING, and then even when you do, they pay you next to nothing compared to private insurance), won't ever have a sliding fee scale, etc.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but almost everyone I know who works in mental health is switching over to private practice, and I reccomend most people I know to do the same. You make less then some fast-food employees when you have a master's degree, and have to deal with people who are borderline suicidal for half your day, while being expected to take on bigger and bigger caseloads, all while support is being cut.\n\nThen at the end of the day, it's the people most at risk, who have so few resources, who are being hurt and left behind in the process.	iTzGiR	1	2025-06-02 19:32:02	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmtb2c	t3_1l1omat	2025-06-02 19:32:13.516187

6760	mvn6id5	Dragon's Dogma 2. I went in with absolutely zero knowledge and experience about the franchise. I kept on reading all the controversy around the state of the game. But once I got in and played I couldn't believe how much I was enjoying it. It really shows how much you enjoy something without being influenced by other opinions. \n\nThat being said, I'm not saying the game is perfect by any means. But the few issues I had with the game were far outweighed by my overall enjoyment. Plus there were a good amount of mods to get the game to play exactly how I wanted it.

6800	mvn6uxz	The only correct answer tbh. That environment is just awful and it's almost solely due to game design.\n\nThe unique bullshit about league is the ability of people to hold you hostage inside the game. They can force you to be in the game with them for 20-30 extra minutes for no reason and you can't escape. All they have to do is not afk and completely refuse to surrender. You get punished for leaving but don't get punished for taking the game hostage.\n\nThey created a game that is gonna take 45 minutes give or take another 15 for queue, loading, and pregame and punish people who just want to accept defeat while rewarding trolls. And Riot's stance is "well our system didn't flag them as AFK so clearly they're trying to win still and that makes *you* the troll".\n\nThey even removed who called for the surrender vote from appearing because they could prove who was holding the game hostage by process of elimination because they'd rather protect the trolls holding the game hostage and making newer players just walk away than punish the correct people.

6882	mvn7rq7	The ICE detainments are immoral, unethical, careless (they have deported citizens), and likely illegal, but at this point they're also unsurprising. This is what Trump says he was elected to do and so far he's been doing it.\n\nSo, honest question here - what I don't understand is, if you're not in the US with a valid visa, why are you still here? Seeing that people are being picked off the streets and disappeared into prisons for months at a time, if you know that your family has overstayed your visas why would you hope you could continue to stay without being noticed by ICE? The writing has been on the wall for a long time now. Even if money is an issue, why wouldn't you wrap up your affairs here and catch a flight to the country where you have citizenship, and work on renewing your US visa from there instead of being at risk of being thrown in prison?\n\nThe coverage of these arrests and disappearances often talk about the victims being upstanding citizens, honor students, volunteers, hard workers, &c. without any criminal records. It's obvious none of those are factors in the arrests. (I was about to say the only thing ICE cares about is that you're a citizen or have a valid visa, but that's not accurate.) As awful as it is that Trump is using this as a tool to make people leave, I don't understand why that's not happening more often.	bkendig	1	2025-06-02 19:42:59	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmlaq0	t3_1l1oduk	2025-06-02 19:43:17.581489

Also most of the rest of that page is specifically pushing back against the narrative your trying to push. \n\n\nAs for the second half of your comment, I have to assume that your pulling those numbers from the first link, but I'm not clicking that thing again.

6958	mvn8re4	I havent played a lot of things but horse mounted combat still doesnt function well at all, even in the recent games like Zelda or Elden Ring. They definitely look and feel nice but its just not generally beneficial to even get on them except for better traveling. A player loses way too much combat options or the attack efficiency drops to hilariously bad while not really offering increase in attack power or defense.\n\nThis leads into another point that there seems to be such a massive issue with player restrictions due to "challenge". I suppose this comes from developer vision and what they think best helps the overall gaming experience, except it really doesnt. Recent example i have of this is a strategy game i played offered a custom coloring option to any character a player controls... but its a very rare, end game item. It should be obvious any player would want to customize their entire squad from the begining of the game but despite the item existing its still effectively impossible until the end of a playthrough. Of course this is purely a cosmetic item so it has zero effect on actual game play.\n\nBasically the bottom line with all of that is, just let players have their fun. Make them complete a "fair" first time around maybe but a lot more things should open up and accessible at least on any additional playthroughs.

7048	mvn9sgt	I played the original Horizon: Zero Dawn (pre-remaster) and it's gorgeous; easily one of the most graphically beautiful games I've ever played.  And that's just scratching the surface; as you've said, the story and the way it is slowly and gradually revealed as you explore more and more of the map is just great storytelling.  There's a decent amount of variety in the enemies you fight, and enough optional side-quests to keep it interesting.  And the Frozen Wilds DLC is stunning also.\n\nI've beaten the main story in Horizon: Forbidden West and am part way through the Burning Shores DLC.  I love Horizon enough that I upgraded my GPU (and power supply) to get the full graphical experience from Forbidden West (my RTX 2070 was struggling due to only having 8GB VRAM).\n\nBoth games are stunning and I am really hoping to see the story conclude in a future third game.	406highlander	1	2025-06-02 19:52:40	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1rds4	t3_1l1rds4	2025-06-02 19:52:54.113736

Overall, the Ys series are ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù games, without too much depth, but extremely fun.\n\nThe games are all set in the same world and are very loosely connected with an overarching story, but the order isn't too rigid. You can start with any game. Especially from Ys VIII - Lacrimosa of Dana and newer titles. With the exception of Origin (as far as I know), each adventure / game corresponds to a diary entry written by Adol Christin, the MC of the series.

More easy, but not impossible. \n\nHonestly, I think the thing that will be most limiting isn't the computers in cars/vehicles. It's the fuel. It's the maintenance. Where are we getting oil, belts, tires, brake pads and rotors, brake fluid, windows, etc. These are all products that would become incredibly scarce.

One of my favorite gaming memories from back in the day was playing the sailing music from Zelda Wind Waker while sailing around in Cube World, exploring islands, fighting everything I could, looting and looting and looting, and just venturing out as far as possible. I really felt like an adventurer, way more than I do in most games with actual stories.\n\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Terraria. Good god man.

7198	mvnbnv4	It's been having an effect for a while. PS1 titles cost $50 in the USA on release around 1997. Today that'd be $100. Games have budgets that are at least 5 or 6x higher on average now but are selling for less. Even with MTX they aren't making it up. This is why we get far less genre diversity in AA and AAA today than we did back then. Good luck selling someone a $100 game that lasts 20 hours even if it's one of the best games ever made like MGS1, I myself would never purchase a game for $80 pre-tax let alone $100.\n\nA former square exec talked about it at length and despite being a hated businessperson everything he said made sense: [https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/05/24/square-enix-final-fantasy-unrealistic-sales-targets-jacob-navok](https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/05/24/square-enix-final-fantasy-unrealistic-sales-targets-jacob-navok)\n\nIn 2025 when you release a game you're competing with every game ever made, and those games are on sale for $5-20 regardless of how esteemed they are. All you really have is marketing hype. If your game is single player you basically have to get lucky and hope people will make an irrational decision to purchase your game before it goes on sale. I don't have any solutions it just doesn't seem sustainable.\n\nI work in software (not in games) and you'd have to be insane to get into AAA game development or a similar purchase once business model because you're making successive gambles that will financially ruin your company if even a single one doesn't pay off. Even Rockstar is one flop from financial ruin.	Bubbly-Swan6275	1	2025-06-02 20:01:43	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvjekxd	t3_1l13bfs	2025-06-02 20:01:55.499735

That home was burned down after over two years of threats from people in the area who repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done.\n\n>Throughout that time we were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship. Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.\n\n>When we returned to the site to check our mail we discovered the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw.\n\n>While we were doing this a man approached us. He started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired.\n\n>Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.\n\n>Jonathan is my husband. He gave me more love in our time together than most people ever get. We were newlyweds. We picked Valentines Day. We were in the process of looking for a trailer and planning our future.\n\n>He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other.\n\n>I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved.\n\n>To everyone who supported him, his fans, his friends, know that he valued you deeply. He saw you as family.\n\n>My focus now is on protecting Jonathan‚Äôs legacy and honoring the life we built together.\n\n>If your concern is how someone coped with trauma or how loudly they speak when recounting injustice and being ignored by authorities then you never truly cared about my husband.\n\n>Jonathan saved my life.

More recently, when I used to play Fallout 76, there were some days where I'd ignore the events and just explore for places with a nice view to build.\n\nWorld of Warcraft also gave me explorer vibes when it was new. I enjoyed most of the expansions, Legion in particular, but for me the sense of exploring wasn't there. I don't know why. The environment design didn't seem worse. My best guess is that after I got to max level in the original, I was constantly aware of endgame progression and I wanted to just get there as soon as possible and start getting better gear.	wonkalicious808	1	2025-06-02 20:05:28	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1r7gm	t3_1l1r7gm	2025-06-02 20:05:39.766461

7275	mvnclry	I started TDA a bit apprehensive, thinking the slightly slower pace was gonna drag a bit. All my runs on each game have been on nightmare difficulty. \n\nThe more I played it, the more I enjoy it. Ultimately I think the high octane pace of 2016 and Eternal are much more my speed (TDA at 150% is fun, if not a little comical but great for a second playthough) but while it differs in some ways, it plays to its strengths.\n\nThe big change that I think doesn't work as well in TDA in comparison is that there is a lot less of a "chess game" loop where each enemy and weapon are pieces that are designed to be dealt with in certain ways like in Eternal, whereas TDA really does feel like "pick your gun and have attem". There weren't really many reasons to use everything to it's fullest potential. Once you had the super shotgun, ball and chain and a couple others you never really NEED to use anything else.\n\nTDA has the same level of hype moments, the boss fights are LEAGUES better than eternal and 2016, the story is actually fun and engaging, if a little silly at times. World and enemy design are great.\n\nI think the one aspect that is objectively worse is the music. You can feel the Mick Gordon wasn't a part of this and it's a damn shame.

7348	mvndoru	This situation was even beyond that because they did move after the homophobes in the neighborhood burned their house down. Here‚Äôs the full context. \n\nStatement from Tristan Kern de Gonzales\nHusband of Jonathan Joss\n\n>My husband Jonathan Joss and I were involved in a shooting while checking the mail at the site of our former home. That home was burned down after over two years of threats from people in the area who repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done.\n\n>Throughout that time we were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship. Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.\n\n>When we returned to the site to check our mail we discovered the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw.\n\n>While we were doing this a man approached us. He started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired.\n\n>Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.\n\n>Jonathan is my husband. He gave me more love in our time together than most people ever get. We were newlyweds. We picked Valentines Day. We were in the process of looking for a trailer and planning our future.\n\n>He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other.\n\n>I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved.\n\n>To everyone who supported him, his fans, his friends, know that he valued you deeply. He saw you as family.\n\n>My focus now is on protecting Jonathan‚Äôs legacy and honoring the life we built together.\n\n>If your concern is how someone coped with trauma or how loudly they speak when recounting injustice and being ignored by authorities then you never truly cared about my husband.\n\n>Jonathan saved my life. I will carry that forward. I will protect what he built.\n\n>‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Tristan Kern de Gonzales	ClumpOfCheese	1	2025-06-02 20:11:28	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmfdu6	t3_1l1mfld	2025-06-02 20:11:39.187161

7362	mvndxh1	Honestly you could probably lock up about 80% of everyone currently employed by ICE and it would have a truly negligible impact on the safety of American citizens.\n\nIf ICE was actually going after "dangerous illegals" then I would expect their digital wall of fallen officers would have an officer who was murdered in the line of duty sometime in the last 14 or 15 years... \n\nSeriously I was curious how ICE stacked up to other forms of policing regarding "putting lives on the line" so I went through their list of those who died in the line of duty, the last one I found that was explicitly murdered was in 2011, his vehicle was ambushed by Los Zetas *in Mexico*. Prior to that there hadn't even been a death since 2005 (it sounds like a wanted fugitive unrelated to an ICE case murdered an off duty agent who possibly recognised him from a bolo after he had earlier murdered multiple people at a courthouse, including the judge presiding over his trial, after getting his hands on a guard officer's gun).\n\nBetween 2011 and today there have been 26 officers/agents who died in the line of duty, of those 26, 22 either died from COVID-19 or were at Ground Zero and later developed cancer. For the remaining 4:\n\n1) contracted Dengue Fever while on assignment in Indonesia\n2) was killed by a drunk driver while on duty\n3) suffered a fatal heart attack while chasing a suspect\n4) was killed when his ICE issued rifle accidentally discharged and struck him in the chest in the process of removing it from the trunk of the vehicle he was using.\n\nSo it's been 14 years since an ICE agent was murdered by "terrorist gang members,"  20 years since one was murdered in America, and over 20 years since one was murdered by an "illegal alien" in America. Honestly I stopped looking somewhere back in the late 1990s INS days and unless I missed one I did not see a single incident where an actual person who was in the US illegally murdered an employee of INS or ICE.

7393	mvnemt0	And this wasn‚Äôt even a confrontation, the neighbor just walked out and shot him. Full context:\n\nStatement from Tristan Kern de Gonzales\nHusband of Jonathan Joss\n\n>My husband Jonathan Joss and I were involved in a shooting while checking the mail at the site of our former home. That home was burned down after over two years of threats from people in the area who repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done.\n\n>Throughout that time we were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship. Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.\n\n>When we returned to the site to check our mail we discovered the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw.\n\n>While we were doing this a man approached us. He started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired.\n\n>Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.\n\n>Jonathan is my husband. He gave me more love in our time together than most people ever get. We were newlyweds. We picked Valentines Day. We were in the process of looking for a trailer and planning our future.\n\n>He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other.\n\n>I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved.\n\n>To everyone who supported him, his fans, his friends, know that he valued you deeply. He saw you as family.\n\n>My focus now is on protecting Jonathan‚Äôs legacy and honoring the life we built together.\n\n>If your concern is how someone coped with trauma or how loudly they speak when recounting injustice and being ignored by authorities then you never truly cared about my husband.\n\n>Jonathan saved my life. I will carry that forward. I will protect what he built.\n\n>‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Tristan Kern de Gonzales	ClumpOfCheese	1	2025-06-02 20:15:57	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm4mds	t3_1l1mfld	2025-06-02 20:16:09.022325

The market is well saturated, so there are just no more buyers if you produce more.\n\nYou could lower the price to increase the pool of potential buyers. But that would also decrease your margin.\n\nSo instead you produce more of your product, keep selling X at the price of Y and then repackage the rest to sell it at a lower price Z under a different brand.\n\nThis way you can gain access to a whole new pool of buyers only willing to pay Z while keeping the margin from selling to those people willing and able to pay more.

You need to be around people, but if you really want to play something here are a couple of games that should suit your needs, rather than wants:\n\nUncharted Waters Online (MMO that is kind to new players, will force you to interract with people as it has a steep learning curve while not having to talk about personal life, just to feel that you're not alone while having a goal to tide you over the sulking period)\n\nPokemon Go (Yes, it's idiotic, but again, dying alone in your room isn't good for you mate. Sun is for the living)\n\nDark Souls 1 (Just finish it once and leave the controller alone and go meet some people. Fuck games)\n\nAll in all, these are not recommendations, these are a crutch to tide you over the crying period. And do it. Cry. And get back up.\n\nLove you mate.

You certainly wouldn't want to wander into a camp unless they knew who you were, or were with someone willing to vet you.\n\nStill, that people need to form camps like this is pretty illustrative of the larger problem - that there are so many homeless, and the resources needed to help people out of this misery are too scarce.\n\nI wish I had the answer to the problem. I don't, but I know that if we collectively treated it with the attention it deserves - enough expertise could come up with some real and fundamental ideas towards something resembling a solution.\n\nMaybe we create an elected office that's role is to be the official go-between for the cities (and other interested parties) and the actual people who're stuck in this awful shit? Idk, but we need to do something differently, cause the problem is getting worse.	Beard_o_Bees	1	2025-06-02 20:24:24	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmxvdd	t3_1l1omat	2025-06-02 20:24:34.80822

But people with your view are often the same ones advocated for unlimited leniency towards criminals and throwing up tons of road blocks in front of cops to limit their policing ability. \n\n\nSo you actively create the kind of scenario you are describing, where known violent people are allowed to share society with us because they havent checked enough boxes to be put away for good. And trying to constantly deal with them only for them to be released on some technicality drains resources so police just move on to more pressing concerns. \n\nIts not as if cops arent doing anything all day. They usually have a backlog of calls going on in real time. If you want these types of people off the streets make it easy for them to be stopped, arrested, and put away.

The story (if there is one) can be short and doesn't require too much effort to make I imagine and its a genre that seems to have a lot of room to expand and innovative.

7678	mvniajp	Case in point. I'm pretty sure the neighbors figured out I was the one who'd reported the dad - who was convicted on a sex offense related to one of the kids when she was 13 - and one morning I woke up and one of my tires was slashed. I called the cops, and when they showed up I explained who I thought had done it and why. They made no attempt to even knock on their damned door to ask questions. \n\nMy last straw was in another town living in a shitty apartment complex during COVID. There were a few families living there whose kids would act up. Before COVID hit I came out one day and chewed them out because they'd found a pile of old bricks and were throwing them in the parking lot. Then during COVID the one family of kids would come out on their stoop and - I'm not kidding - howl like wolves for hours on end while my wife and daughter were trying to do work and schoolwork remotely. So one night about 1:30 a.m. they were out on their stoop (3nd floor) yelling and throwing empty beer bottles off the stoop into the parking lot. I'd reported them to management already (who'd done nothing) and decided to get some video on my phone. I went around to the side of the building hoping they wouldn't see me, and when I got close a beer bottle whizzed by my head. I went back to the entrance of my building and they were laughing and yelling at me. I decided to call it a night and apparently my downstairs neighbor had called the cops. Four cars showed up, and not a single cop was wearing a mask. They asked me questions and I explained what had been going on. I kid you not, the main cop said "did you ever stop to think these kids might be bored because of COVID?" I lit into him and said "what about my kid who's trying to do her schoolwork and can't concentrate because these kids aren't being supervised?" So they talked to the parents and had the kids apologize to me and said they'd write up a report and gave me a case number, which I wanted to show the apartment management. I called the police office a few days later; the report was never submitted.	Strict-Marketing1541	1	2025-06-02 20:33:12	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvn401p	t3_1l1mfld	2025-06-02 20:33:25.462124

It's fun to combine hints, explore the crime scenes, visit locations, talk to people, go to a bar, observe people from your appartment window when it's stormy outside, the list goes on.

7733	mvnivzo	Try [Kenshi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/). It's a pretty hardcore sandbox game that has a really vast world with different cultures, towns and the likes in it, with some on-going conflict. It's granted not the prettiest game, but you will inevitably explore a lot as you look to find your way in the world, finding books and text and context clues for the world around you as you go about your tasks, whatever those are. There's no "winning" condition in Kenshi other than what you yourself set, whether that's to be a traveling merchant, a bandit, a smuggler, builder and manager of an entire town, slave abolitionist or whatever else.

7919	mvnl8k6	### Video Editing\n\nApparently Linux does support DaVinci Resolve which is my video editor of choice, and a strong competitor to Premier. However, on Linux it has the drawback of no AAC encoding/decoding, which is a pretty big drawback. I wouldn't be surprised if there were other issues beyond that; that's just what I found after a quick search.\n\nI also use Kdenlive for quick edits, but for anything substantial, DaVinci Resolve is 100x more powerful. (free to use, give it a shot!)\n\n### 3D Modeling\n\nI love Blender. I use it almost every day. It's great that it's fully supported on Linux. I believe Maya is too. But other industry standard programs like 3ds Max and ZBrush aren't. ZBrush is irreplaceable for me; it's by far the best sculpting software. Maybe there's a way to make it work but I'm sure it would be annoying/buggy.\n\n### CAD\n\nThere's also the issue of CAD software in general which Linux has very few good options for. I just looked into it and it seems one of the best options is FreeCAD... that's unfortunate. I've used it but I would much rather use something nicer and more stable. \n\n### Games (Steam)\n\nAccording to ProtonDB, only 6% of the Steam catalogue of games is 'Platinum' rated, meaning they run perfectly. The picture is better if you're only looking at the top 1000 games. 35% are Platinum, and 46% are 'Gold' which means they run perfectly after some tweaks. Then 8% are 'Silver' which means they run with minor issues but they're generally playable. So, fortunately about 89% of the top 1000 games are 'playable' on Linux. That's not too bad, but you may be out of luck for certain games, especially if they're not very popular. \n\nThere were 15,000 games released on Steam last year and something like 85,000 in the last 10 years. There will probably be roughly 18,000 released this year. So, the top 1000 is a pretty small pool of games. \n\n### My Conclusion\n\nHaving taken a quick look at the state of software support on Linux in 2025, I've reaffirmed that it's not worth it yet, *for me personally*. **I do believe that there are significant performance gains with less overhead on Linux in most cases.** It's tempting to ditch Windows bloat/telemetry for an optimized Linux build, but the lack of specific software support is too big of a catch for me, at this time. I am confident that it will continue to improve; it's only a matter of time until Linux is too attractive to pass up.

7921	mvnl956	>Iran also violated that deal by storing enriched uranium at undisclosed sites between 2009 and 2018. \n\nWell, no, that's not what the IAEA report says. It says they were doing a lot of weapon related stuff up until the early 2000s and that some of that contaminated equipment was stored for decades later. \n\nThere's actually no evidence that Iran violated the JCPOA before Trump pulled out. The non-proliferation violations mentioned in the article you linked have been known about for a long time and were part of the reason we negotiated JCPOA in the first place. \n\nI'm not saying the Iranians are 100% honest, but the narrative that they didn't uphold their end of the JCPOA is mostly nonsense. The deal worked because they were significant incentives for them to comply and they were complying until we decided to break it ourselves.	thrawtes	1	2025-06-02 20:47:11	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvnbuc8	t3_1l1ja5y	2025-06-02 20:47:23.877523

That home was burned down after over two years of threats from people in the area who repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done.Throughout that time we were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship. Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.When we returned to the site to check our mail we discovered the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw.While we were doing this a man approached us. He started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired.Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.Jonathan is my husband. He gave me more love in our time together than most people ever get. We were newlyweds. We picked Valentines Day. We were in the process of looking for a trailer and planning our future.He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other.I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved.To everyone who supported him, his fans, his friends, know that he valued you deeply. He saw you as family.My focus now is on protecting Jonathan‚Äôs legacy and honoring the life we built together.If your concern is how someone coped with trauma or how loudly they speak when recounting injustice and being ignored by authorities then you never truly cared about my husband.Jonathan saved my life. I will carry that forward. I will protect what he built.- Tristan Kern de Gonzales\n\nSource: [https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1HJj172kiH/](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1HJj172kiH/)	Imaginary-Dress-1373	1	2025-06-02 20:55:07	news	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1mfld	t3_1l1mfld	2025-06-02 20:55:30.035373

They would drive in on the weekends, just one night a weekend, and break into 3-5 cars each time. \n\nOne break-in and the cops will shrug. But collect two months worth of weekly evidence of repeat offenders and now they've got enough to throw the book at 'em.

8077	mvnn8tv	The reason is because you have a lot more readily available talents that can quickly get on the ground running. While a in house engine would take a while for talent to get up to speed. Not only that, but if you learn how to modify UE according to your needs that skill is transferable to all other organizations that are also using UE.\n\n\nImagine a senior game dev that uses UE finding they need to make the engine more performant, he can go to the manager tell them the needs for another developer to take on the on-going feature implementation while he diverts his focus to modifying the engine according to their needs. Instead of getting a dev that needs 30-90 days to get up to speed on just the in house engine, they instead can almost immediately start working on new features because they know how the engine works. They just need to learn the specific parameters of that project.	PlanZSmiles	1	2025-06-02 20:56:42	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvn9pxm	t3_1l1mxmr	2025-06-02 20:56:56.122973

8121	mvnnms2	> Thats like people crying that RDR2 couldnt run on a GTX280. Or The Witcher 3 not running on a Geforce 7800gtx. Or shit, Cyberpunk not running on a GTX 480.\n\n\nTerrible analogy. There were massive jumps in graphical fidelity between those generations that justified the upgrade. We haven't seen any serious improvements since 2018. Things just got blurrier and harder to run - but we're supposed to be happy because UE5 makes it easy for devs, even though those games run like shit on *new* hardware too, and the only setting that really affects performance anymore is upscaling level, because everything else is baked into the engine and can't be easily (or at all) disabled.\n\n\n\n> You are a PC Gamer, you signed up for upgrading shit every 6 years.\n\n\nNope. I signed up for games being adjustable to run on a wide range of hardware, which was the case for a long time.\n\n\n> Either you dont wanna move on, are are too broke to drop 1500 every 6 or 7 years on a PC upgrade.¬†\n\n\nI can afford to drop 1500 *every month*, miscreant. Doesn't mean I want to. I have principles. Such as not giving my money to enable lazy developers - or, worse yet, money shaming people as part of my argument. Piss off.

You basically play as a space archeologist, flying to different planets and uncovering the secrets of the past through exploration. It's almost like a Metroidvania but instead of finding the power-up to get to the next area, you discover some secret knowledge that let's you pass a seeming insurmountable obstacle.

8185	mvnobs5	Yeah and the issues present in E33 are exponentially relevant for the type of games CDPR makes.  The movement in E33 is janky, you get stuck on random invisible walls, clip against the tiniest objects on the ground, and the platforming is terrible.  These are things that the game can get away with because it's a turn-based RPG that warps you into another dimension during combat and every animation is static and pre-rendered.  \n\nImagine having the Gestral beach minigames but that's the entire game.  It'd be fun as a gimmick game like Only Up or Getting Over It are fun but not as an actual open world exploration game with combat.  An action combat system in E33's execution of UE5 would be considered borderline unplayable by modern standards.  \n\nWith regards to town clutter and objects, while E33 is incredibly beautiful, there's a lot of static uninteractable images hidden behind invisible walls so that you can't look too closely.  On top of that the game is incredibly empty in terms of the number of mobs that are actively loaded into the game.  I wouldn't be surprised if Novigrad alone has twice or thrice as many mobile NPCs as the entirety of E33.  On top of that, every single explorable zone in E33 is instanced with a load screen which means that fewer resources need to be committed to memory at any given time, whereas open world games are comprised of large continuous zones.	silencecubed	1	2025-06-02 21:01:56	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm81uf	t3_1l1mxmr	2025-06-02 21:02:09.490719

Like when you learn about the serial killer Ed Kemper who lived with his mother and went out and killed women after arguments with her before making her his final victim, and find out that his father described being married to her as being worse than his experience on the front lines in WWII. Makes you go "ok, serial killing is obviously indefensible but if his mother was *that* awful, it does answer some questions". \n\nI've seen the video (unfortunately), and the couple that get shot are pretty fuckin horrible in even that short clip, and they keep it up literally right up until the final shot. It by no means justifies their murders, and their murderer should rightfully have been punished if he hadn't offed himself at the end, but it does answer some questions.	feioo	1	2025-06-02 21:03:37	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvnfede	t3_1l1mfld	2025-06-02 21:03:49.410967

You give them orders and such and they build and farm or do whatever tasks you laid out. By the games nature it‚Äôs often quite time consuming in a fun way. I find it really addictive making new rooms as my dwarf population increases, expanding my building projects and whatnot. It sounds a bit overwhelming but the steam release has a good tutorial as well that fully introduces all the mechanics you will need to learn.\n\nIt‚Äôs also a cheap indie game made by a small but dedicated group of people and you can feel the passion and love put into the game. 10/10 experience.

And I don't think that kind of game even exists yet. \n\nI'm a disabled vet and have a lot of time on my hands. Because I have been physically unable to move around and do much outside the last year or two, I've been playing a *lot* of games. And I played games very often even prior to this time period. \n\nBut the last couple of months, I will turn my PC on, intending to play something, only to find that nothing is providing what I *really* want to do in a game. Your edit provided the words that I couldn't think of myself. \n\nEvery game I have tried to get into lately has been either too simplistic, had too much hand holding, doesn't give enough freedom, or is just plain boring. I'm sure I could find a few more descriptors if I thought long enough about it.	HolierThanAll	1	2025-06-02 21:06:42	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1r7gm	t3_1l1r7gm	2025-06-02 21:06:57.273504

That home was burned down after over two years of threats from people in the area who repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done.\n\nThroughout that time we were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship. Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.\n\nWhen we returned to the site to check our mail we discovered the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw.While we were doing this a man approached us. He started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us.\n\nHe then raised a gun from his lap and fired.Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.\n\nJonathan is my husband. He gave me more love in our time together than most people ever get. We were newlyweds. We picked Valentines Day. We were in the process of looking for a trailer and planning our future.He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other.I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved.To everyone who supported him, his fans, his friends, know that he valued you deeply. He saw you as family.My focus now is on protecting Jonathan‚Äôs legacy and honoring the life we built together.If your concern is how someone coped with trauma or how loudly they speak when recounting injustice and being ignored by authorities then you never truly cared about my husband.Jonathan saved my life.

It's lighthearted and optimistic rather than serious, and is a turn-based JRPG, but its entire core premise (other than the major conflict of course) is exploring the entire world and discovering new continents and cultures. And there are even "discoveries" you find by exploring in your air ship and interacting with the overworld map to find them. It has strong nautical/pirate vibes too, just, in the sky. Definitely has explorer vibes, and as you get access to better ships you can explore more levels of the "sky ocean." Alas, it's not available on modern platforms.

8424	mvnr0tp	It really depends on what kind of game you are looking to play. If you are at work I would play something that doesn't take up too much time between actions. A game high in micro would not be ideal because at some point (that 10%) you will have to work. If you like MMOs I'd say Old school RuneScape, because there are a lot of skills you can train that take afk time between level ups and there are not a lot of inputs in between. However if you are looking for a single player game the. Most games you can pause should fall suit.

I was the plant mgr and had an office.  we were down for the summer vacation doing maint while the plant was down but some shipping and stuff was going on. I had 3 dept guys there too but it was mostly just sitting and riding the clock. Only there in case we were needed. they had offices with their pcs  too and it was all networked of course. I had read and write privileges. on the sys. So I brought in some discs with Doom on them. Loaded them up on our 4 pcs and we deathmatched all night.  I thought I had it hid good but the owner's son who was the real sys admin found it. he came to me on the downlow later and said he found it and left it and thought it was cool that I figured out how to do it. Said it wouldn't hurt a thing and not to worry.	ChainLC	1	2025-06-02 21:15:50	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1tg4d	t3_1l1tg4d	2025-06-02 21:16:01.189276

That only happened ages later with No Man's Sky. \n\nMy brother n' me didn't have the manual or the map, just the cart. So we were talking to aliens, writing down the coordinates we were told. We had no idea what we were really doing and wound up just grinding the ship and TV to the max and flying around to explore. \n\nGot to really play it more recently and it's a great game.

I'm, of course, looking at the article "A." Doesn't say as a punishment for every crime, nor does it say every prisoner; it says "a punishment."\n\nGrammatically, it would seem that slavery would be a separate sentence, but that's from a layman's reading.

8577	mvnsmmp	>Where did I say that though? I basically was saying worrying about patient gamers as some industry destroying force is pointless. \n\nIt hurts niche titles. Mimimi Games basically said there isn't enough revenue to continue in the business so they are shutting down their business after their latest title. They released niche but feature complete titles. My point is just don't bitch when titles you like that actually respect gamers end up on the curb because just waiting for better deals does kill small studios. Its why some companies just say fuck sales all together like Factorio, Starsector, and/or rimworld (they have loosen their grasp on this stance for the base game over the years)\n\nFor smaller studios and titles to survive in the AA space, you have to buy at launch or they will just get shitcanned.

And It wasn‚Äôt consecutive time, right? It‚Äôs not usually a definitive situation.\n\nMost people that I work with or know don‚Äôt know about this and every single person instinctively believes that homeless people are violent or dangerous. I can‚Äôt control my anger in those moments. But, you don‚Äôt want to simply say you were once, very much homeless. \n\nSo I just end up looking like an asshole. Fuck it though, I don‚Äôt care. Someone has to defend the person out there right now. Yelling in their car in the parking lot doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to stab or rape you.

The people who voted for those things in an area that votes against it shouldn't be punished, especially when you're talking about things that are literally life or death.\n\nI know there's not really a way to do that, but I wonder how things would change if people knew they were opting in or out.

8791	mvnusiw	I was a professor of Computer Science at a University of Texas campus for a few years, and all I can say about this is: it cannot be worse than the bullshit that already goes on.\n\nIn the state of Texas, the curriculum of every college and university is already governed by what's called the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB).  It was established in the 60s because students transferring from one university system (say, Texas State) to another (like A&M) were unable to receive credit for many or most of their courses, because core classes like intro writing did not have state-wide standardized course descriptions, and thus the registrars of one university did not recognize nearly-identical classes with fully-identical function in the curricula.  Like most things enacted by government (I'll point out that in 1965 this was a 99.4% Democratic legislature across both houses), it was done with good intentions but had horrible results.\n\nI can't speak about how the standardization has gone as far as disciplines which are relatively static in their content, such as English Literature, language studies, History, Philosophy, etc.  Those topics do not change radically in the span of a decade or so like some of the STEM fields (specifically technology and medicine) do, and it's possible that they have in fact benefitted from standardization.  For Comp Sci specifically, I can say with certainty that what we are required - by law - to teach is about 20+ years out of date.  Part of this is due to the meddling being done by the government, and in the case of UT part is also due to internal bullshit.\n\nThe University of Texas also has a Board of Regents (which is also appointed by the state, because of course they are).  This board consists of nine people who are - almost exclusively - lawyers and business execs.  Not scholars, not scientists, currently only one person who received a real doctorate (an M.D., not counting JDs because three years and a test does not make one an academic).  The curriculum of every major, every discipline, every subject is decided by these people who apparently know absolutely nothing about how best to teach the material in any given subject (let alone *every subject*), and whose ideas about what sort of curriculum and best practices result in graduates who are prepared for the job market and can actually get a job are woefully, tragically misguided.\n\nAs a professor, what this means is that as much "academic freedom" as the department claims I have as far as how I teach my classes and what I cover, I have *at least* four groups of people who get to dictate to me what I can and must do; the two most powerful of which being the least-qualified to make those decisions.  Those are the THECB, the UTBoR, one or more accreditation boards, and the department itself.  The latter two generally speaking know what they're about and are competent and capable as far as getting shit done and doing it right (in my view, and assuming we get any funding).\n\nSo, as I see it, I can view this news - assuming it is being reported accurately - in one of two ways.  Either I can take the pessimistic view and add one to the list of overpaid, incompetent morons above me who get to tell me how to do my job; or I can take the optimistic view that what appears to be a consolidation of power means I can remove one from that list, as the government gives the BoR a much-deserved kicking and now there's only one government overlord I have to answer to.\n\nTl:dr: I see a lot of snarky comments from people who don't know shit.  Unless you understand the bullshit we already deal with or you live in Texas, shut up and let us work it out on our own.  For those of you who are making comments about how bad things are in Oklahoma, my CS education from an Oklahoma university was quite good, if a little behind the cutting edge (they didn't create a single class covering neural networks until like 2023), compared to the absolute clown show that passes for an education my students end up graduating with.  Compared to graduating from a top-100 (national) university in OK, the degrees we give out in Texas might as well be printed on toilet paper and our employment rates prove it.  I despair for the future that my students face, especially the new undergrads.	mathwin	1	2025-06-02 21:33:57	news	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1sitq	t3_1l1sitq	2025-06-02 21:34:20.125099

You could seriously message him on FB or call him on TikTok and if he had time he'd talk to you for a whole damn hour. He was always gracious to people approaching him in public. (From what I hear, anyway.) It's part of the reason why so many people in the KotH fandom were rooting for him - he was extremely public and frank about his troubles and also genuinely loved the characters he played. Unfortunately, this also made it VERY easy to see the issues he was having. Lots of reports from regular fans saying they talked to him online and it was clear he was drunk/high on something.

8874	mvnviyk	My notes so far:\n\n\\-Absolutely stellar voice cast. Charlie Penguinz0, Jackcepticye, and so many more bring the game to life\n\n\\-The gameplay is pretty fun, especially with the time management and how certain characters have unique interactions with certain jobs. \n\n\\-The dialogue is great, but a bit tedious to get through if you just want to replay the dispatch section to make different choices. I hope in the final product they add some sort of save file system so i can keep my dialogue choices but still get to replay the dispatch section. \n\n\\-The animators did an excellent job as well. This legit looks like a TV show I would watch if it was free on streaming. \n\n\\-If I had two bullets and was in the room with Hitler, Stalin and Flambae, I would shoot Hitler and Stalin and then kick Flambae in the balls. Like there's definitely an interesting character with him, but I almost want to never deploy him for reasons I think might be obvious. \n\n\\-I am very interested to see where this goes, hope it releases (WITH A SAVE FILE SYSTEM PLEASE) soon!

What you are testing is emergency operations plans, communications, equipment available, resources available if needed, implementation of MOUs (Memorandum Of Understanding ), etc.. This typically happens in a single room with an exercise controller providing the scenerio and situation injects. The drill is evaluated using an After Action Report. Then an After Action Plan provides the fixes to any issues discovered. The fixes are then tested in the full disaster drill. \n\nTLDR:\nTypically a tabletop exercise is conducted to hash out the details before a full disaster scenario exercise.\n\nQuestions welcome.

We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.\n\n>Jonathan is my husband. He gave me more love in our time together than most people ever get. We were newlyweds. We picked Valentines Day.

Never got to be a console player though, only owned Switch for a while.	etozheboroda	1	2025-06-02 21:46:47	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1uci2	t3_1l1uci2	2025-06-02 21:47:03.123668

We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done.\n\n>Throughout that time we were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship. Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.\n\n>When we returned to the site to check our mail we discovered the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw.\n\n>While we were doing this a man approached us. He started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired.\n\n>Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.\n\n>Jonathan is my husband. He gave me more love in our time together than most people ever get. We were newlyweds. We picked Valentines Day. We were in the process of looking for a trailer and planning our future.\n\n>He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other.\n\n>I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved.\n\n>To everyone who supported him, his fans, his friends, know that he valued you deeply. He saw you as family.\n\n>My focus now is on protecting Jonathan's legacy and honoring the life we built together.\n\n>If your concern is how someone coped with trauma or how loudly they speak when recounting injustice and being ignored by authorities then you never truly cared about my husband.\n\n>Jonathan saved my life. I will carry that forward. I will protect what he built.\n\n>Tristan Kern de Gonzales	RodneysGhost	1	2025-06-02 21:48:54	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvnw9mu	t3_1l1shl4	2025-06-02 21:49:05.721233

9145	mvnyqou	I‚Äôm blown away people are pissed about 80$ games. I personally don‚Äôt think any game is worth more than 30$ for the COMPLETE edition.  But people are fuming about this when companies spend one work day developing a ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù skin and selling it for 20$ and he‚Äôll skins that are 60$+\n\n\nThis is such a stupid hill to die on. People spend 70$ every year for copy paste garbage like madden, fifa, COD. And people don‚Äôt think gamers are going to spend 80$ on a full brand new AAA game? So silly, Starfield had 150k players alone on early release on steam. Which was $100 for early access. That was steam by itself. And that game was trash.\n\n\nPeople need to realize most gamers are just frivolous spending cockatoos that ooogle and awwww at whatever the new thing is. It‚Äôs a damn shame. But it‚Äôs the truth.

9161	mvnyyey	We had consoles handed to us down by our relatives who are well off. And these consoles were the previous generation. For eg. we only had the NES when our relatives already have SNES and we only had PS when they already have PS2. It stopped on PS3 onwards because they stopped gaming but they sold their PS2 to someone else. \n\nOur games were hand me downs as well. And since my older siblings have more authority in our house, they played most games first. I had no choice but to watch them play and enjoy it from a spectator‚Äôs POV. Never got to finish any classics because by the time I played the games (from the small library we had), it was already late at night or the plot has been spoiled by watching them. \n\nWhen gameboy consoles came out, my classmates had them except for me. I remember one of my classmates tricked me that he will lend his own so I kinda did a few homework for him - only to find out that he actually did not have one. He was simply manipulating me ü•≤\n\nSo I kinda forgot about it growing up until a few years I picked up 3DS for a great year at work. I had to visit the gaming store multiple times unsure whether to buy it or not. Convinced myself I deserved it after seeing the employee kinda trying hard to smile after I walked through their doors for the nth time. Bought Pokemon Y along with it. \n\nAnd now even though I do not have the latest GPUs, the consoles like PS5 or the NSW2, I am happy. I can play whenever I want in my own time, my own room and with my own consoles. No more getting spoiled nor tricked by anyone.

There was a recent KOTH panel that he wasn't invited to (I don't know why not) that he crashed and caused a big scene at, and I've read his drug use has been getting worse, apparently the fire that burned his house down was caused by him leaving an outdoors heater inside the house.

9209	mvnzl28	I had a very harsh mindset about homeless people. I think it came from my realizing that I was taking care of a largely homeless population in a psychiatric hospital. A few bad patients who happened to be both homeless and violent suddenly became all of the homeless patients I would meet. I felt like my empathy for others was being overridden by this shitty projection. Anyway, my hospital is on strike and the little money I‚Äôm making is bringing me closer and closer to me being homeless myself. I feel ashamed that I let my assumptions dehumanize others. I hope that you‚Äôre no longer homeless and doing well, and if you‚Äôre still struggling, you matter.	slayer_ornstein	1	2025-06-02 21:58:14	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvmnrr3	t3_1l1omat	2025-06-02 21:58:25.790898

9273	mvo0g1h	An excuse? An excuse for what? I literally haven't excused anything, and I'm not rejecting """data""" for anecdotes, I have literally been at the front of multiple surveys of local homeless populations since there's such high crossover with the AMH population, and the only reason it happened more than once is because there was a new director who insisted that "*actually,* the reason the last one didn't get good results is because you did it wrong" - spoiler alert: we did it as well as it could be done, and it sucked both times, because asking people who are experiencing heightened symptoms to provide you with legible feedback is folly, which you would know if you'd ever done anything beyond posting from your streaky office chair.\n\n\nAre you under some delusion that we fingerprint/DNA test homeless people against some type of national database whenever they enter services? Do you think as they spiral downwards into their own personal hell, they maintain an up-to-date set of identifying documents that would allow us to actually do a comprehensive background check? What "data" from this study do you find so wholly credulous as to completely disregard the lived experience of people who actually work with homeless populations in favor of the nuanced take of *Business Insider*, I am dying to know.

At least some of the games I played were originals, because I remember having manuals.\n\nThen I remember the chinese versions of the Famicom. With gems like Super Mario 8, Super Mario 16 and Street Fighter III.\n\nYears later, in highschool I got the SEGA Megadrive (the brazil made version of the Genesis) and I mostly rented games. Which were, of course, pirated versions too.\n\nAnd when I got my first PC, an XT, then an AT 386, I remember going to the computer store, buy a box of floppy disks (first 5 1/4 and later 3 1/2) and looking into the catalogue of games (a list of games printed in the store), and for a title, then watching how the clerk copied the game using Norton Commander.\n\nMuch later where CDs instead of floppies.\n\nAnd the PS2 modded to accept the pirated copies.\n\nThen with Internet I could do it for myself.\n\nAnd a good day, Steam appeared with sales. And since I was an adult then, I finally got games legally.	rincematic	1	2025-06-02 22:04:17	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1uci2	t3_1l1uci2	2025-06-02 22:04:29.07021

9322	mvo15ai	Poland from early '90 to 2000.\n\nMy first gaming era began where our aunt from Germany gave us her old C64 with bunch of diskettes. It was somewhere around 1994 I think. I was playing on that one hazard. Disassembled and assembled it and checked what's inside.\n\nLater during elementary school, one of colleagues had a Pegasus (Chinese knockoff console) at home, so we played that one as well with legendary 1000-in-1 diskettes.\n\nNext stage, first PC with Win95 on Intel MMX around 1999. I remember that we were playing some demo games that were added to paper magazines. DSJ (there was literally insanity about this game in Poland in early 2000 because of Adam Malysz), Sokoban, Happyland Adventures. Lot of small games that were played through and thorough because there wasn't anything else.\n\nGenerally, living in poorer family in poorer countries means that if something's broken, you're not buying new part - you just wait couple of months or years until someone richer can give you his old ones or if parts in general become so cheap that will be more affordable. I remember getting GeForce 2 MX from my wow-addicted friend in high-school, that helped me a lot.\n\nAlso piracy was almost like legal in Poland in early 2000. Everyone knew someone that would burn a CD with games or movies for you. I remember watching Two Towers for the first time from pirated CD with rmvb (real media video, does it even exist today?) that I bought for like 2pln. That was the only possible access to media for smaller and poorer cities \n\nNow I'm adult in late 30, who can afford config I wanted (but no RTX5090, fk NVIDIA and this pricing). And I still play company of Heroes from 2006. Some things never change	Herbata_Mietowa	1	2025-06-02 22:06:28	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1uci2	t3_1l1uci2	2025-06-02 22:06:40.28775

Has nothing to do with corporate healthcare, and all to do with the current federal and state admissions, who have drastically cut almost all of our funding and decided mental health isn‚Äôt a real thing that‚Äôs important. 60%+ of our funding comes from the state and federal level, so when that‚Äôs ALL getting cut, and then our reimbursement rates are also going down (again due to the current administration), so that 40% from actual patient visits are also getting cut. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt an issue with the board just being money hungry or something, our entire leadership team, including the CEO just took a massive pay cut too. This is an issue of the fact we as a country, have just decided mental health isn‚Äôt something we need to put money into or fund, realistically because those in charge right now, just think mental health is some liberal myth or something, we literally got our list of banned words about two months ago (since we‚Äôre federally funded), where we can‚Äôt even use the word ‚Äúharm reduction‚Äù because that‚Äôs too woke.	iTzGiR	1	2025-06-02 22:09:20	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvo0llz	t3_1l1omat	2025-06-02 22:09:31.819413

9371	mvo1r1w	It would probably be more fun if you knew at least a little about the 40K-verse, but it's a pretty solid 3rd person shooter on its own.\n\nUnless they tweak this bit, I will just say that there's one point where you're probably going to be busy killing Orks and then all of a sudden get a game over screen. It's because there are suicide bomber squiggoths running around who sneak up on you then blow up and kill you. Keep that in the back of your mind and remember to try to keep close to a wall or something so you can see everything coming.

9417	mvo2csk	First console was Sega Genesis. I played for a bit before something happened and it went away. Then I got a PC at around 9? I think. \n\nSome of my first games were Black & White from Lionhead Studios, an emulator with 256 games from Sega, Flash games on the internet and other random games like 102 Dalmations, Warcraft, Max Payne, Cossacks, GTAs, Sims... \n\nEverything was pirated, of course.\n\nThroughout the years I ONLY played on PC and my tastes haven't really changed much. I played WoW, UWO from MMOs. RPGs and Strategy games were my jam mostly.\n\nToday I don't game much but I still like retro games more than modern ones. The only REALLY good games I can say I like from the more recent ones are Dark Souls, Stardew Valley, Kenshi.\n\nI bought a weaker laptop on purpose as not to get tempted to play too much, but honestly I enjoy modding and Roleplaying in a couple of older games more than playing the new big titles with insane graphics.\n\nAnd I'm not saying this through some nostalgia glasses, but it's how I am. I would rather imagine the world and immerse myself through weaker graphics and have my mind fill in the blanks and imagine a larger world rather than 4k fast combat.

These issues *are* addressable, but it requires organizing and system building, in particular organizing and system building outside the existing system. There is every reason to believe such efforts will be forcibly opposed, as even under liberalism prior efforts were stamped out (although in that case it was lower on the outright violence and higher on the creating legal mechanisms and mass propaganda that what we will be facing in coming years).

9460	mvo2zpg	> It hurts niche titles. Mimimi Games basically said there isn't enough revenue to continue in the business so they are shutting down their business after their latest title. They released niche but feature complete titles.\n\nTo put that all down to patient gamers is ridiculous, especially when patient gamers are not the majority. Especially in the strategy genre where even big names are so-so on sales. \n\n>My point is just don't bitch when titles you like that actually respect gamers end up on the curb because just waiting for better deals does kill small studios.\n\nMost studios don't fail because a demographic waits for sales. Most fail for a multitude of factors from marketing, to pricing issues, to devaluing their own work quickly via bundles, and beyond. Feels like a few favorites of yours failed and now you want to point the finger at people fed up with "supporting" studios that don't give a fig about their audience. \n\nLook at how many "huge fans" were shat on by various crowdfunding projects. The people waiting years and years for a follow-up to their favorites... and instead the studio pivoted to churning out licensed slop chasing Marvel money, MMO money, MOBA money, battle-royale money, or extraction game money(???).\n\nLook at Rebellion and Tripwire or the Payday people whose name slips my mind, they all had rather dedicated core fan-bases that would buy like everything to support. They all exploited the shit out of that fact as they got more "success" and mismanagement. \n\n>Its why some companies just say fuck sales all together like Factorio, Starsector, and/or rimworld (they have loosen their grasp on this stance for the base game over the years)\n\nI bet that strategy makes it harder to ever get newcomers or revitalize sales over time. Sometimes someone takes the plunge on something new because the price was tempting and then become a massive fan. Especially once you're years out from release and years out from major content changes/updates. \n\n>For smaller studios and titles to survive in the AA space, you have to buy at launch or they will just get shitcanned. That is my whole point. VOTING WITH YOUR WALLET GOES BOTH WAYS. You buy what you want to see in the industry and yo don't for things you dislike about the industry\n\nSure, but again like I said you're worrying about everyone doing the patient gamer thing which isn't going to happen. It's just not. \n\nBut even if by some miracle it did, the market would adapt. \n\nAnd personally for what it's worth I do put my money where my mouth is and support things I like. But it's still gotta be a good deal for me, I'm not indebted to these studios or franchises. If they make something great like Clair Obscur great I'm all aboard, but if their next project is an extraction PVP game (just an example) none of their current base owes them support on it.	dookarion	1	2025-06-02 22:16:17	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvnsmmp	t3_1l13bfs	2025-06-02 22:16:41.477803

9467	mvo33lt	there's a website I forget the name of that converts sensitivity values between games and/or IRL measurements. Really what needs to happen is that inches of mouse movement -> degrees of camera rotation needs to become standardized across a range of standardized FoV values. And also FoV calculations should be standardized so that games either present both horizontal and vertical field of view or if unified it's the same math for every game (or just standardize how sensitivity should compensate for different FoV so that changing FoV does not affect sensitivity). Then windows, at least with games, needs to send basically 1:1 mouse input by default without acceleration to games. Such that raw mouse input only needs to be checked for special cases. \n\nThen to change sensitivity you just adjust your mouse DPI or a basic multiplier. so say you like having 1000 dpi just all the time but in games you typically prefer 1.4x that, once you have that locked down \\*once\\* you just use 1.4x in every game and it just works the same. \n\nThat's not that far from what we have to do now, but standardizing this math would take out a lot of guesswork after working out your individual preferred sensitivity once. It's kinda wild how different the sensitivity values for games can be to achieve the same "mouse distance per 360 degree rotation"	EnlargedChonk	1	2025-06-02 22:16:53	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvnj3ea	t3_1l1lzha	2025-06-02 22:17:09.427858

9490	mvo3jbg	I'll answer you: it's not true. What *does* happen is that prisons like one in Connecticut can charge you for being there like one woman who got an $83K bill for 2.5 years in prison on drug charges. Since it's privately owned, you will not be jailed for not paying it, but you can be sued for it.\n\nOf course a bill like that is going to turn someone potentially homeless and likely to wind up incarcerated again because of it, creating a cycle where the debt puts them in for longer indirectly. I couldn't find anything about a sentence being extended due to debt, though. You can go to jail for not paying the state court fees, taxes, etc. but that generally doesn't apply here as state/federal facilities don't charge like private ones can.	spinto1	1	2025-06-02 22:19:14	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvnvjyf	t3_1l1t0iq	2025-06-02 22:19:28.392639

9532	mvo4gh5	"¬†Yelling in their car in the parking lot doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to stab or rape you"\n\nNo. But it means that there may be a small chance that they're going to stab or rape you, and very few people will take even a small risk. The problem is not most of them is violence. The problem is that no one even wants to run a small chance that they may be, because there is no benefit in interacting with the homeless.\n\nAnd it is not just the homeless, people are generally guarded against strangers too.

They are also much, *much* easier to make.\n\nThe price of a product depends on how much it cost to make it, yes, but also on how much **the market is willing to pay**. Judging by the reaction to Randy's comments, the market obviously is not interested in a 80 bucks game - let alone your 120. Unless, of course, it is of exceptional quality.\n\nStop seeing this from the "oh the poor CEOs are barely making it with these 60$ prices guys". The videogame market keeps breaking record profits year after year, don't worry about that.\n\nAnd trust me, if you double game prices, the devs won't see that extra cash - it just means some investor gets to buy another house in Monaco this year.

9587	mvo5aiq	It's the pacing for me. Cyberpunk is *way* too dialogue and story heavy, especially in the first half of the game. It really put a hamper on my desire to replay it because I didn't want to sit through all the long walking and talking segments again. In theory, the background stuff should help to vary it up, but ultimately being Nomad, Streetkid, or Corpo makes very little difference.\n\nDon't get me wrong, what's there is good and I enjoyed it all the first time, but video games should be about finding the perfect balance between gameplay and narrative. If I wanted to watch a movie, I'd watch a movie.	Cranharold	1	2025-06-02 22:28:46	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvn4i93	t3_1l1mxmr	2025-06-02 22:29:04.08384

When they make new space discoveries they put them in the game. Go visit Voyager 1 and 2, famous stars, nebulae, whatever. The map is so big the game has been out for a decade and less than 1% of the map is explored with tens of thousands of players continuously flying around. Some people have circumnavigated the Galaxy. Starfield wishes it could do this.

9615	mvo5rra	Growing up in the 90s in Lithuania it was the Chinese NES clones with yellow cartridges. Sega was seen very rarely, mostly in rich kids homes. Also some games on parents' PCs, mostly Minesweeper, Solitaire, Free ell and Hearts. Later I got some CDs with demos of games which I really liked as well as some old DOS games. The PC I played on was cheap though and lacked even a sound card. Later we started getting bootleg PC games, mostly imports from russia. In the PS1/PS2 era, you would go to play these consoles to an internet cafe/gaming salon. Then the internet really opened up in around 2003 or 2004. I was in college, and the country was already much richer than before, so most young people could already afford decent gaming PCs but all the games were always pirated. With Steam and consoles becoming more popular at home, and the games becoming really affordable while becoming more difficult to crack, piracy declined in 2010s significantly and now that we are almost as rich as everyone else in Europe the gaming experience is not much different from anywhere else.	pliumbum	1	2025-06-02 22:31:26	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1uci2	t3_1l1uci2	2025-06-02 22:31:41.067654

9702	mvo6nve	Except they aren‚Äôt right when they say it‚Äôs because the devs are lazy when in reality it‚Äôs seither or both because they devs are just not that experienced with the engine or simply don‚Äôt have the time/money to spend months and years on optimising the games. UE has some terrible documentation that has only slowly been getting better so it‚Äôs not an easy undertaking to optimise a game in it.\nBut calling developers lazy in an industry famous for overworking and underpaying people because the people in charge can exploit their passion for games is either dishonest or stupid.	n_ull_	1	2025-06-02 22:36:21	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvn1cif	t3_1l1mxmr	2025-06-02 22:36:32.890585
9703	mvo6ojv	I don't think it fits your mold (assuming you're asking about "Outer Wilds", not "Outer Worlds", they're 2 different games).\n\nFor one, it's not exactly relaxing. One of the things that can happen in there is being stuck in space without no way to save yourself, so you'r only choice is to wait for your oxygen to go out so you die suffocated. Some people actually feel pretty scared of this kind of thing, and there other similar things that can happen.\n\nThe game is also very serious. The story is quite tense and full of mystery.\n\nIf you want a game to "turn-off your brain and just have fun", Outer Wilds is NOT the game for you. You'll actually need to use your brain quite a lot in there. That said, it's not a very demanding game to play. Other than getting used to the ship 3-dimensional controls, the game doesn't require much skill.	Deive_Ex	1	2025-06-02 22:36:27	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvnaivj	t3_1l1r7gm	2025-06-02 22:36:42.448789

Fix the system that created the situation! \nAnd it isn‚Äôt as simple as ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt afford to go to college then don‚Äôt take out the loan‚Äù.\nThat has the potential to mean that only wealthy people will be able to join professions that require post-secondary education. We don‚Äôt want that as a society. Wealth doesn‚Äôt equal capability or intellect.\n\nUnfortunately, this is likely to happen for professions that require a graduate degree with the changes the GOP included in their stupid bill (limiting graduate school loan amounts so only wealthy people would be able to afford to become doctors, for example).	chillybean77	1	2025-06-02 22:40:29	news	f	\N	\N	t3_1l0rjzw	t3_1l0rjzw	2025-06-02 22:40:41.456255

Something connected to attribute ratings and difficulty sliders that is rapidly moldable when starting each new game. \n\nIt could be that it's too much for today's game engines and we'll need more advancements/focus on AI integration there.

When a person says "all new games are roguelikes," they do not literally mean that 100% of new games are roguelikes, they just mean that a lot of them are.

I'm absolutely fed up with the excuse that it's okay for new games to run much worse just because they're new or use <insert tech>. *It doesn't matter.* What matters is the framerate vs graphical fidelity. If I can't tell the difference between a 2018 game and a 2025 one but the 2025 one runs several times worse, the verdict is that the 2025 game has horrible performance. I don't want to give developers money for using <insert tech>. That's not my problem. If <insert tech> ruins performance while barely improving the visuals, don't use <insert tech>. Simple as that. I don't want to see ray tracing forced anywhere and I don't care that it makes it easier for developers. It's been 7 years and it still runs like shit even on latest cards. Give up on it already.

9871	mvo95d1	iirc last time I tried rebinding in GTAV I discovered that by default some actions are bound to the same keys, but if you rebind them they each need to be an individual key or something... That's one of the few games I gave up on rebinding and just use wasd with a controller on standby for driving parts. \n\nSome games like crysis remaster let you rebind keys, but apparently they forgot that they hardcoded the exit vehicle key to 'f' i believe, so you could have esdf steering in the vehicles, but don't try to turn right or it will eject you with no option to rebind. \n\nPacific drive is the latest to get on my nerves, again you can rebind almost everything to work with esdf but some menu options are hardcoded to use 'e' and 'q' to change tabs, so even though you can rebind the cursor in those menus to esdf it's useless trying to go "up". could use any four keys for the cardinal directions in the inventory, as long as they don't include 'e' or 'q'. All because the dev just doesn't want to? and the only mention of this is a pin in the discord with a rather condescending "you just can't do that". Also the faq on their website rubs me wrong. Like the steam deck support faq is "we are a small team, we don't have time" same with VR, sure I get that, and there's no obligation to work on steam deck or VR mod support. But blaming it on the size of the team is just... not the play. They should just own to the idea that they don't want to bother. I've seen solo devs with a better attitude. Which is funny because in other faq entries on the very same page they handle it how they should "we have no plans for that", simple, effective, gracefully blunt... I usually find it hard to fault indie and AA devs for being sloppy like this but come on, so close yet so far. \n\nHelldivers 2 is pretty ok, some things don't let you select some modes of tap or hold but for the most part things can be bound to press, double tap, hold, and I think one other option...\n\nThe absolute best was unreal tournament 2004. In game setting was pretty basic but everything \\*can\\* be rebound. Where it really got good was modifying the plaintext file that stores keybinds. It was basically raw access to the engine's, keybind scripting system or whatever. You could program button chords, basic macros, mouse movement events, the works, for every game function. You could even script hold and release to do different things in the same binding and use *fucking arrays of weapon binds*. I had it so that I could scroll down to select between the weapon slots that line up with close range stuff, scrolling up gave hitscan weapons, and then a few keybinds for favorites that if pressed while the favorite was equipped would return to the previously equipped weapon. I even had a button on my mouse that when held would switch to the shield gun, start charging an impact, then upon release it would fire the impact, and jump, kinda like a mini rocket jump but less painful, then it would return to previous weapon. Everyone had access to this, everyone afaik was using it, there were guides on how to set things up, especially weapon switching. If someone decided not to take advantage of it, everyone else wasn't cheating, that one guy was just a dumbass. **absolute peak rebinding**	EnlargedChonk	1	2025-06-02 22:49:54	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm11vl	t3_1l1lzha	2025-06-02 22:50:06.160596

9894	mvo9fmz	Intersex does include people born with outwardly identifiable male and female body parts, in which cases doctors/parents would generally ‚Äúpick‚Äù one (in the US, not true of every culture, not sure on Puerto Rico specifically) and that would often include surgery to adjust the baby to match a single gender which sometimes didn‚Äôt work out well.\n\nIt also includes people who may outwardly only present as one gender but aren‚Äôt, which was much less likely to be noticed until recent history. \n\nFor example, if you are born XXY you may outwardly appear ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and never realize that is the case without a DNA test. You‚Äôll still likely have symptoms, but since people exist on a wide range and there are a variety of things that cause similar symptoms, that being the cause likely goes unnoticed until recent history.\n\n\nAs a whole I think as our understanding of both sex and gender and the mind grow, so should our ‚Äúrules‚Äù about it and it turns out most of our understanding has leaned into ‚Äúwow, there is a lot of edge cases and a lot of non-standard stuff happening as we learn more‚Äù. \n\nHaving an ‚Äúother‚Äù option seems like a no brainer solution to me, but like half the country will freak out about it despite it never even effecting them.	surnik22	1	2025-06-02 22:51:27	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvo58v2	t3_1l1vkv9	2025-06-02 22:51:39.781858

9896	mvo9gmc	Well for one most of these games do look a lot better if you compare them side to side, but because increasing the quality in graphics has started to get diminishing returns in the last 5-8 years it‚Äôs not that obvious if you don‚Äôt do those active comparisons. Secondly many of these games do stuff that is technically demanding but isn‚Äôt as obvious as better textures. Stuff like more complex animations, AI, draw distance, more complex environments‚Ä¶\n\nYou can make an argument that maybe those improvements are not worth it in some cases and I think that could be a valid point, but games do also often just try to push the boundaries just for the sake of it, which is what pushes the industry forward. It‚Äôs also true that people are using older hardware for longer now because of how expensive it has gotten, which many developers might not be considering as much as they should.\n\nAll that being said, it‚Äôs still also just true that most devs don‚Äôt have the time and budget to optimise their games as much as they should.	n_ull_	1	2025-06-02 22:51:35	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvnfxvp	t3_1l1mxmr	2025-06-02 22:51:50.298789

9927	mvo9wzt	I can give you a semi quick spoiler free summary of some elements in the game below, if that gives you any idea what to roughly get to grips with. Anything mentioned below is visible in the trailer.\n\nSpace marines - Poster boys, genetically engineered super soldiers. The come in various flavours, we get the blue flavour - Ultramarines. A very vanilla faction but straightforward and effective.\n\nOrks - They like fighting. A lot. Their entire existence is centered around finding a good fight and having fun with it. These guys are a good time.\n\nChaos - Eeevil. Basically there is a place called "the warp" that is made of the emotions of sentient things. Very strange, full of demons, all corrupting and generally a bad time.\n\nThe Imperium - Who the Space Marines fight for. This is the human faction. Ruled over by a psychic corpse on a life support throne.\n\nImperial guard - the Imperium's standard fighting force of normal humans.

9928	mvo9xtj	The claim that Iran violated the JCPOA by storing enriched uranium at undisclosed sites between 2009 and 2018 is misleading. Any such activities before 2016 were not covered by the deal, and the IAEA found no evidence of an active, undeclared nuclear weapons program after the JCPOA took effect.  \n  \nThe international monitoring regime confirmed Iran‚Äôs compliance with the JCPOA until the U.S. withdrawal in 2018, after which Iran began to exceed some limits in response.  \n  \nBlaming Iran for violating the JCPOA during the period it was in force is not supported by the assessments of the IAEA or most international experts.\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/timeline-iran-election-nuclear-f3beadc54c44a9ff74989cbf45d9a270](https://apnews.com/article/timeline-iran-election-nuclear-f3beadc54c44a9ff74989cbf45d9a270)	IchooseYourName	1	2025-06-02 22:54:11	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvnbuc8	t3_1l1ja5y	2025-06-02 22:54:24.875912

Are you telling me it‚Äôs impossible that any corporation is spying on people? You gonna tell me none of these companies are using their spyware extract customer data to train their garbage AI? Please. Verizon specially was caught giving their customers‚Äô data over to the government. Calls, text messages, everything. For over 14 years at the time when the news broke.

9978	mvoaj77	>Archeologists and environmentalists have expressed their outrage at a shock decision by Peru‚Äôs culture ministry to cut by nearly half the protected archaeological park around the iconic Nazca Lines, excluding an area nearly the size of urban Lima, the country‚Äôs capital city.\n\n>The Unesco world heritage attracts thousands of tourists to see the massive hummingbird, monkey and whale figures in the desert in Peru‚Äôs second-biggest tourist attraction after Machu Picchu. Last year, archaeologists using AI discovered hundreds of new geoglyphs dating back more than 2,000 years, predating the famous lines in the sand.\n\n>‚ÄúThey are trying to rub out history,‚Äù said Ana Mar√≠a Cogorno Mendoza, president of the Maria Reiche International Association, a non-profit created to protect the Nazca Lines. ‚ÄúThe area that is being separated is exactly where some of the oldest rituals took place, according to our research.‚Äù Maria Reiche was a German-born mathematician who pioneered research on the Nazca Lines in the 20th century. \n\n>Critics of the move say it will weaken decades of environmental protection and open up the Nazca Archaeological Reserve to informal and illegal mining, just as international gold prices peak.\n\n>Peru‚Äôs culture ministry, which decided on Friday to reduce the Nazca reserve from about 5,600 sq km to roughly 3,200 sq km, said the decision was the result of a 20-year study and consultation and did not affect the Unesco World Heritage destination or its buffer zone.\n\nIllegal mining is already a serious problem in the region and around the famous geoglyphs, and this will make it much worse. \n\nI always wanted to visit them since seeing them on an episode of [*In Search Of‚Ä¶*](https://youtu.be/rb_0zL_VtJg?si=2eER5y8C0teP1-v8) as a kid. Finally got to visit them last summer and it was incredible. A unique part of history is at risk.	CupidStunt13	1	2025-06-02 22:57:23	news	t	\N	\N	t3_1l1w61v	t3_1l1w61v	2025-06-02 22:57:41.586982

10032	mvob5c3	I‚Äôm not saying that the study is fundamentally flawed, but I will point out that there is some suspect methodology.  For example, California is significantly likelier to include undocumented immigrants in such totals, because of the general higher level of societal support, and the California agriculture industry causes a lot of migration for such work on a seasonal basis. California also features societal, governmental, and cultural support for ‚Äúoutcasts‚Äù, people who had to leave home because of their religious beliefs, gender identity, sexual orientation, or other such reasons, and who tend to disproportionately end up unhoused (because they‚Äôre basically starting from scratch with no familial support). It also simplifies residency to the most recent address; someone who moved to California and loses their home with the first few months is, by this cited study, a long term California resident. \n\nBasically, this is pretty close to lying through statistics, which is why the narrative about it continues to reject the flat numbers put forth as inappropriately reductive of the complexity of the situation.

10036	mvob70d	I've been playing Civ since the first one (1991...well, actually since the board game, but that's a different story). I have played them all, and have hundreds, if not thousands of hours in each of them. I like Civ 3 the best because I think it is the most granular (very detail oriented) and doesn't have some of the newer gameplay features I dislike (religion being the biggest one). I think the game has become a little softer over the years (which is good to bring new players in), but it has lost the strategic edge it once had. The newer ones are prettier, sure, but I believe they lack the complexity and user-based interaction the first ones in the series seemed to capture. Now, things seem more paint by numbers and watch the downstream actions flow than actively engaging each and every action inside of each and every turn. But this is only my opinion and based off the continued sales of the IP, it appears not a very popular one.	hand_truck	1	2025-06-02 23:01:00	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvo4lbt	t3_1l1tg4d	2025-06-02 23:01:12.492018

If they can say they are a part of the court system, then they can pressure for arrests as a result of not paying "court ordered legal fees" (something they would absolutely get after a lawsuit).\n\nAnd while you can say, "Well, can't send them back to jail!", they also can never just *move forward*, because they will have their wages garnished, their assets seized, and their credit destroyed to the extent that they can't even afford basic needs like a car or get electricity turned on without a $500 deposit.	techleopard	1	2025-06-02 23:01:37	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvo3jbg	t3_1l1t0iq	2025-06-02 23:01:49.420002

That doesn‚Äôt work for people who are trying to get or keep employment. They also often require people to leave by 6 or 7am; ok in the summer months, but downright dangerous in the winter, when a camp would be able to provide shelter and heat throughout the cold period. \n\nAnd we shouldn‚Äôt gloss over the common religious requirements. Many shelters require people to partake in a religious ceremony to be given a place for the night. Even if one‚Äôs personal religion does not prohibit that practice, belonging to another religion is often enough to get someone denied access.

10103	mvobw32	They could have optional granular settings where you input your monitor's size and resolution, your mouse's DPI, and your Windows mouse sensitivity (or use Raw input), then it could calculate in-game camera rotations per 12 inches, which is roughly the size of the average mouse pad.\n\nThat way you could dial it in, as many people do manually via trial and error, so that one full swipe on your mouse pad is a 180 degree turn.\n\nOr something along those lines, depending on your desired sensitivity. Maybe you're playing a shooter and like lower sens, and only want to turn 90 degrees per mouse pad swipe. Or maybe you have a really big mouse pad and you want to turn 180 degrees per 24 inches of mouse movement (which would be the same as turning 90 degrees per 12 inches).\n\nI think it would be great if games would have these types of measurable distance settings tied to mouse sensitivity, to take the mystery out of making your sensitivity perfectly consistent between games.

10142	mvoc9pa	They're stand alone. My recommended order is 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Non-7 remakes and remasters are fine for graphic and QOL improvements. Play 7 remake last. Also try Final Fantasy Tactics. \n\nThe above order gives you a decent feel for the fantasy and sci Fi aesthetics without being too jarring, I think. Also, great way to see how the soundtracks have evolved over the years, and how Japanese pop culture has influenced the series.

10145	mvoc9za	You are SO wrong. The inactive ingredients can REALLY matter.\n\nReal Advil tablets are shaped like m&ms and have a smooth coating with a tolerable taste. Most generics are cylindrical without that coating. If you have difficultly swallowing pills (as I did when I first switched to should medicines from kids ones), this makes a big difference. What's more, my father just discovered THIS WEEK that the reason his stomach was getting upset when his back pain acts up is that Costco's ibuprofen uses lactose as a bulking agent.\n\nEven worse, between Beano and its knockoffs? one has lactose and another has mannitol. Which brand you use determines whether you get even worse digestive upset than the beans would cause, for many people! \n\nAnd then, there's the many topical medications that use lanolin in their base ointment. Sure, it just causes mild irritation and itching.... but do you want to put an irritant into already irritated eyes or onto eczema you're trying to treat?! Fuck no! I have it listed as an allergy in my medical files for exactly that reason, even though it's minor... and still, neither doctor nor pharmacy caught it on multiple occasions, because it isn't an active ingredient. There's no alternative version in many cases, either.\n\nAsthma rescue inhalers since they forced the switch to HFAs? Different propellants between brands, which, of course, can trigger some asthmatics' lungs.\n\nSo no. Very big no. Generics are NOT always the same even when they use the same delivery method (in general terms) to deliver the same dose of the same medication. The devil is in the details.	ornithoptercat	1	2025-06-02 23:06:56	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvlp5gc	t3_1l1i9if	2025-06-02 23:07:07.725987

10148	mvocbaj	helldivers 2 does a mostly decent job at this. it's not perfect as it's pretty obvious that reloads are broken into individual steps that if interrupted return to the beginning of that step, and some animations have too few of those steps. But it remembers the round in the chamber, doesn't charge if there's still one in there, and lets you fire it mid reload if it makes sense. Still dumb to sometimes put a magazine in twice because the putting the mag in animation wasn't *quite* finished when it got interrupted, but it's better than most other games in that there is actual attention to detail. \n\nalso as a side note, the optics kinda behave like optics do, you can't see through them until they are lined up with your eye, and you can see the black outer circle move as it lines up in the very short animation of you pulling the gun up to the "aim down sights" position. Also also, the sights iirc used to be zeroed at certain ranges and bullets used to leave the barrel. But because this caused bugs where things didn't line up right they eventually switched to the more basic method most games use of the bullet is technically fired from the center of your optics rather than the barrel. used to be kinda neat that "oh this scope is zeroed at 150m, I have to aim low at 75m", but it was not so neat when that turned to "I have to almost always aim low and left because it fires high and right every time except at extreme distances past the zero where I have to suddenly aim high again." So I understand why they changed it.	EnlargedChonk	1	2025-06-02 23:07:08	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvm3wz3	t3_1l1lzha	2025-06-02 23:07:22.744697

Sometimes I had to use so-called "injectors" to launch a game, because it wouldn't otherwise. Out of those as I remember were Witcher 3 and Dragon Age Inquisition. But playing them was unbearable just like watching a slide-show. As I started to get interested in gaming community I made steam account a bit later, but I didn't also expect anything to buy on it, because I was either low on money or didn't have them. I usually "played" games on YouTube. Since 2018 that I started to have real money and a credit card I've been filling up my game library.\n\nP.S I'm from Ukraine.

10202	mvocwmv	> Secondly many of these games do stuff that is technically demanding but isn‚Äôt as obvious as better textures. Stuff like more complex animations, AI, draw distance, more complex environments‚Ä¶¬†\n\n\nI keep hearing that excuse yet UE5 games that run poorly don't do any of that stuff. They are not "pushing the boundaries" in any way, except how badly they can run.\n\n\n> It‚Äôs also true that people are using older hardware for longer now because of how expensive it has gotten, which many developers might not be considering as much as they should.¬†\n\n\nOne, those games run poorly even on brand new hardware, even on cards with enough VRAM. Two, I don't want to upgrade even though I can afford to easily - simply because none of these new games look even remotely like they deserve an upgrade. Upgrading from a 970 to a 3060 Ti was a no brainer when I wanted to run titles like Shadow of the Tomb Raider at higher framerates (mind you, they still ran well on the 970, especially when I upgraded the CPU). Upgrading now doesn't make sense to me when I see games like Warframe optimizing the hell out of their engine and putting out updates with massively improved graphics and lighting that *still* run perfectly (and by that I mean triple digit framerates) without upscaling, ray tracing, and other bullshit. I don't want to pay just to enable lazy devs using shitty engines. And what's the point anyway? In a year or two suddenly even a 5080 won't be enough for them, and you'll need super-duper-multi frame generation just to run 60 fps, because it's so hard for poor developers to do their fucking jobs, and Jensen Huang needs a new yacht. Fuck them, and fuck the people excusing this circus. I shouldn't *have* to upgrade to run something that often looks *worse* than older games.\n\n\n\n> All that being said, it‚Äôs still also just true that most devs don‚Äôt have the time and budget to optimise their games as much as they should.¬†\n\n\nWhich is why UE5 is terrible for the industry. It enables them to do exactly that.	VengefulAncient	1	2025-06-02 23:10:25	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvo9gmc	t3_1l1mxmr	2025-06-02 23:10:37.060295

The idea that every developer has to go over budget or scale back their budget to compensate for UE5s issues is kind of ridiculous. Epic should fix the issues they created with this engine.

10219	mvod0bd	Okay its quite clear we just aren't going to agree on this. I hope you have a nice day\n\nbut to your last points\n\n>Look at how many "huge fans" were shat on by various crowdfunding projects. The people waiting years and years for a follow-up to their favorites... and instead the studio pivoted to churning out licensed slop chasing Marvel money, MMO money, MOBA money, battle-royale money, or extraction game money(???).\n\n\n>And personally for what it's worth I do put my money where my mouth is and support things I like. But it's still gotta be a good deal for me, I'm not indebted to these studios or franchises. If they make something great like Clair Obscur great I'm all aboard, but if their next project is an extraction PVP game (just an example) none of their current base owes them support on it.\n\nThis is honestly the stuff that annoys me. I get it to a degree but so many gamers want developers to just go all in on a project and fly by the seat of their pants. I get not wanting to buy something because you don't care for the genre and at the end of the day the devs are merely people and people can get greedy but I think many people underestimate how much it cost to finance a game. Its quite obvious how you talk you simply don't care how the sausage is made, you only care about the sausage's endstate.\n\nYou point to expedition 33, which is a fantastic game mind you but how it exists is quite fascinating. Its the result of a trust fund baby. Not the worst usage of a trust fund but it is a very unique position they are in since I want it to be remembered Guillaume Broche first job in the gaming industry was as a "Assistant Creative Director" for might and magic 7, when he was still in college from my understanding. So it is easy to say man fuck any studio who is trying to "cash in" on the latest trends but when it can cost millions of dollars to run a game studio, you can't really place it all on the line and expect a bailout if said project fails. Its why making the easy things or the trendy things happens. \n\nSo I do hope you have a good day since this convo is just running in circles.

Is it just surround sound mode? is it enabling HRTF on headphones? is it changing the levels things get mixed at for the strengths of the average of those options? There's quite a difference between "stereo PC speakers" from logitech and "stereo nearfield bookshelves with subwoofer", so what is the intention behind "stereo speakers".

Exploration is key because you have to find resources to progress. Not many people and the story is very unfinished but lots of unexplained lore to find and piece the world together. The map is technically infinite with seasons and hot equator/frozen poles.	baverdi	1	2025-06-02 23:17:07	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1r7gm	t3_1l1r7gm	2025-06-02 23:17:20.890563

10326	mvoe8mk	I'm from a country with low per-capita, but I've been lucky in that I've managed to have at least one console for each generation.\n\nMy parents usually tried to please us kids, though we weren't exactly current. When I started working at around 19 (dropped out of my 1st college) I bought my 1st console by myself, the PS1. Them PS2, PS3, PS4. (I usually bought them years after the initial launch, when you could get them for cheap. Honestly, the best way to buy into technology nowadays, with all the day 1 patches and bullshit). \n\nJust some days ago, I pulled the trigger and ordered a PS5, 5 years after initial launch. For the 1st time in almost 40 years of playing videogames, the console _isn't_ cheaper, and may in fact get more expensive. I'm seriously thinking that if this is the trend, I will not be getting a PS6.	Noirceuil_182	1	2025-06-02 23:17:44	gaming	f	\N	\N	t3_1l1uci2	t3_1l1uci2	2025-06-02 23:18:00.938229

10391	mvoet0e	Roguelite is not really a genre in the way strategy, stealth or puzzle are, it's a way to structure a game. Darkest dungeon is a strategy/management game, people that for some reason label it as a roguelite will say it's "strategy/management roguelite", so I'm just disputing the latter part. XCOM is similar to darkest dungeon but it has an actual loss condition (if you don't save scum) and yet nobody really calls it a roguelite.

10395	mvoeuu9	Because it's true. \n\nThey get hurt in those places, the staff are not trained, there is seldom security, when they do have security, they're practically useless or opt not to get involved, only calling police.  Also, in a lot of those places, nobody is "vetted" to get in - there are no background checks that eliminate violent offenders, especially in shelters that describe themselves as "low barrier." \n\nThe shelters that do have rules are very strict too, making it nearly impossible to get in unless you fit perfectly within those lines. Curfews can be a problem for the unhoused who hold jobs too, and the shelters are only open for them during certain hours overnight, so during the day - they're still wandering the streets.	will_write_for_tacos	1	2025-06-02 23:21:10	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvobg2v	t3_1l1omat	2025-06-02 23:21:30.139477

10400	mvoewfc	Rhythm Heaven for Wii. (also known as Beat the Beat depending on your region) One of my favourite games to have ever existed. Gets easily overlooked because it resembles the typical Wii party game rubbish at first glance. But if you actually play it, it is aboslutely one of a kind amazingly fun to play. The gameplay is so simple but so easy to get into. It's not the typical music game where you have to watch a staff of scrolling notes and press the correct buttons. Instead, each song is a hand-crafted rhythmic challenge that's designed to test a specific rhythmic concept.\n\nThere were also Rhythm Heaven games on 3DS, DS and GBA that are also just as good in the same way. But the Wii one is my favourite of the bunch because it feels like a complete  package from start to finish.

10408	mvof085	They don't understand the concept of certain engines being better for different types of games. Their logic is that if one game can run well, all games regardless of what they're doing should also run equally as well. In their mind E33 running well means that a huge open world game with high density of assets and real time combat should also run well. They don't consider the variables at play at all. UE5s design does a good job at facilitating the development of smaller linear titles, but it's a pain in the ass for larger scale open world titles. Which is why you see most AAA studios that make open world games just design their own engine for it.

10433	mvofbyf	It depends on the volcano. The 1991 eruption of Pinatubo supposedly decreased temperatures in the northern hemisphere by 0.5¬∞C in the following summer due to massive injection of sulfuric acid into the atmosphere. Most volcanos will not do that most of the time and no other erruption in the area of modern measurement instruments had such an effect.	jeseusatan	1	2025-06-02 23:23:48	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvlywls	t3_1l1jonm	2025-06-02 23:24:00.219947

10436	mvofcep	I‚Äôm fine with this but does anyone else think it‚Äôs weird they put gender on a birth certificate at all? Like if anything needs recorded anywhere it should be sex because doctors need that to provide good care. They should have male, female, or intersex.\n\nBut gender? Gender is fluid. It‚Äôs entirely possible that someone who identifies one way will change that as they get older. So why have gender on a birth certificate? Are people going to have to file to amend their birth certificates later? It just seems tedious for no reason.\n\nAlso if there is a reliable way to communicate sex to doctors without asking patients (because patients aren‚Äôt always able to communicate with their doctors), why even have sex on the birth certificate?

Or other times, simply just snot nosed kids who use political upset as a way to fuck shit up for fun. \n\nThis is still considered non violent protest if actually done for a cause but they did a shit job at it if literally no one who sees it knows what or why they chose it without them ‚Äúclaiming‚Äù it was them. \n\nNOT saying I condemn it but a ski lodge in Vail, Colorado was burned down in ‚Äò98 after earth liberation front members got word they were planning on expanding and threatening more fragile wildlife populations. Burning peonies with no real reason or political statement isn‚Äôt a valid form of protest.

10446	mvofgbx	as a big fan of crysis, they definitely also fucked up cloth physics and hair too. But it's amazing how unfucked it is for 2007. And there definitely wasn't that heavy of fog, but it did use LODs and occlusion to save on a lot of performance. Volcano island means you can render more basic geometry with LOD trees for the small portion that is land, the rest is open ocean, or there are trees dense enough that you don't need trees to be drawn in very high detail at all 200 yards away, still wasn't really enough, especially for PC's of the time. \n\nIt could have better performance today, but the engine was built to take advantage of single core high clock speeds instead of multithreading, and whatever directX calls they were making are barely supported by modern GPUs.

"I gotta go pray or sign my life away or get a drug test?" - Sometimes, Christian-based charity is conditional; we were not, and a lot of the unhoused were shocked that we were just people making food for them and giving them supplies.	will_write_for_tacos	1	2025-06-02 23:26:35	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvobssb	t3_1l1omat	2025-06-02 23:26:46.313774

I had a lot of complaints about Botw that Totk addressed and improved. To me, it was way more fleshed out than I thought it would be. Even the story elements were far more fleshed out. In BotW, I didn't remember much of the story, but in Tears, I felt like they did it justice. There were so many pleasant surprises when exploring in Tears vs Breath. That's just my opinion though.

That doesn't mean you pull iron on that neighbor and murder him. Dude needs to go away forever. Just saying Jon's husband is making some claims that go against Jon's actual words.

10621	mvohgr4	[That depends](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/02/24/debtors-prisons-then-and-now-faq)\n\nIt all depends on the debt. \n\nAnd it is amazing how fast it adds up when you get arrested and held for weeks with out trial.  And when you don't have money and can't pay the debt they are trying to force you to work for the prisons.  Fortunately in many states they can not force you.  But they try every trick in the book to get you to agree to work for basically nothing in horrendous conditions. (look up how many prisoners get injured yearly) From being in a safer place to letting you have a pet.  Anything to get you to work.\n\nPeople should research the companies that do this stuff and put them on the Nestle list never buy from them.  Go after companies that do business with them.  Make them admit in public that they are ok with slavery.	wanderingpeddlar	1	2025-06-02 23:35:45	news	f	\N	\N	t1_mvobb57	t3_1l1t0iq	2025-06-02 23:35:57.559387

It's a very vertical game as well with lots of huge stuff to scale and underground places to explore. The open world exploration aspect really allows you to make the game as hard as you want too. Because you never get roadblocked by any bosses you can always just go explore more to keep leveling up. Eventually you can just out level a boss and come back and stomp it.

10674	mvoi6c6	Can we make a game that doesn't involve bullet sponges?\n\nI think it's goofy and not very fun when you shoot/slash enemies and they barely flinch or don't respond at all except maybe grunt. All that happens is their HP bar goes down a bit. \n\nI would like it if every attack that connected actually made the enemy flinch severely and had lasting consequences. Like if you shoot their hand, that hand should be out of commission, at least temporarily. If you shoot their leg, they fall to the ground and can no longer walk on that leg, they start hopping around or try to shoot you while they're laying on their back. And a headshot or chest shot should be pretty much an instant kill. \n\nSame goes when the player character is receiving damage.\n\nI understand that from a gameplay perspective, this would make the fights extremely short and hardcore, but I think it could work and would make the games really tense and fun. Tarkov actually has a pretty decent approach to this but they don't go far enough, IMO. Location does matter, arm damage makes your sway go crazy, leg damage makes you hobble around. And they balance it by making different types of healing kits for broken bones, bleeding, or regular minor damage, and the bandages only take a few seconds to apply so it's not game over if you get shot a few times. Unless you're bleeding out and don't have the anti-bleed thing, then you bleed out on your way to the extract. I like that though. \n\nBut the issue still remains that when you're shooting someone, they are just absorbing the shots like you're have a water gun fight, and shooting back until their HP reaches zero, rather than instantly getting dropped from the violent physical impacts of supersonic lead hitting them.\n\nMaybe it's a terrible idea, but I've been thinking about it for years, I'm curious what it would be like if the first shot was basically everything and landing a shot pretty much anywhere on the body meant they would get instantly crippled, most likely falling to the ground and dropping their weapon. Then it would be a scramble to see if they could recoup themselves in time before they got shot again (probably not). \n\nIt might also be fun against monsters or supernatural beings. Creatures that could conceivably eat some shots without being crippled. Think of like a Grizzly bear. It might take several shots and keep charging, but each shot would probably make it flinch and slow it down. That could apply to armored aliens, or fantasy creatures. It would be awesome to see every shot have a physical, animated effect on their movement and behavior, instead of just being bullet sponges.

10703	mvoiknp	Then be angry with Jensen and the industry for forcing devs into this position, but don‚Äôt pretend the problem are lazy devs. The problem is that hardware has barely improved while getting more expensive. Games and studios are being bloated making them less efficient while also ballooning budgets so high that delays are often not possible (at least to the degree necessary) meaning devs simply cannot optimise their games. This isn‚Äôt a problem with UE5 (exclusively) almost all games of the past few years have been terribly optimised for the reasons mentioned above, it‚Äôs less a problem with the tool nor with the people who use the tools and more how these people are being forced to use them.

Failing to pay that additional fee can land you in jail. In short, reworded it to say "failure to pay fine" so they can send debtors to jail. \n\nIt's one of the few countries where you can buy your way out of pre-trial prison (bond). Where there's an private industry monetizing on people being poor (bond lenders). There's going to be backdoors to throw debtors in jail.

10826	mvokji5	Keep in mind I'm not defending him however while he's forgetting that? A lot of you are forgetting that while yes getting the game out the door is *vastly* cheaper now? Making it has really gone up.\n\nRemember games like that back in those days got made by much smaller teams. Doom was pretty much made by five people at ID with some more folks like Sandy Petersen coming in later on. I think Wing Commander had about 15 or so folks working on it at the end. \n\nToday? You've got programmers, map makers, artists, the soundtrack people, you've got the 'support' staff if you will picking up phones and doing the paperwork. That's on top of voice actors/actresses, paying bands if you are doing music like they did in Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nSo where yeah back in the 1990's putting out a PC Game that had a bunch of 3.5 disks and feelies and the like, or putting it on a cart for the Genesis (Mega Drive for you UK folks) or SNES cost a hell of a lot more then making it.

10868	mvokwwv	>So, if I'm just traveling light with my house keys and phone, and I don't have documented proof of my citizenship & residency, they just get to fucking detain me?! And honestly, what counts as enough "papers"? My driver's license? My passport? My birth certificate and social security card? My voter's registration card? 2 recent utility bills? A bank statement? Tax return? Like what the fuck papers do I fucking need?\n\nAre you an Alien? If so, your (unexpired) Green Card or EAD should be carried on you at all times. If you're under a separate program or waiting for an extension/renewal after expiration, supporting documents as well. cf [https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1jy03rq/is\\_it\\_true\\_that\\_youre\\_required\\_by\\_law\\_to\\_carry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1jy03rq/is_it_true_that_youre_required_by_law_to_carry/)\n\nIf you're a US Citizen or National you're not required to carry any ID on you at all. But if they have reasonable suspicion, within the 100 mile border zone, that you may be an illegal alien you can be detained until you can be positively identified; they're entitled to demand documents from an Alien, and they're don't have to release anyone just for saying magic words with no evidence. \n\nThis is obviously inconvenient for all involved. \n\nWhat counts as reasonable suspicion for detainment? The bar is relatively low (much lower than probable cause for arrest). Obviously a pre-planned sweep of a workplace after a tip off will be the case, as well pretty much anything else. If you're present in a house and the police enter it, you're also not going to be necessarily going anywhere any time soon.\n\nIf you'd think you're at risk of being caught up in a sweep or are surounded by illegal aliens who you think might be targeted, it behooves you to carry ID on you. **Any valid government ID and knowing your SSN is actually all you need to be looked up. But stronger the ID the better**, and a WHTI-compliant document is best. So a Real ID is better than a regular DL, and an Enhanced DL/ID is better than a mere Real ID since that confirms your US (or Canadian) citizenship.\n\nIf you don't have or can't get either, a passport card is perfect for this situation. That's the standard advice here in San Diego if you think you're at greater risk for mistaken identity or want to carry more proof for whatever reason -- especially since California passed AB-60 giving DLs to illegal immigrants, meaning you can't just use the ID as tacit legal presence proof anymore.

10949	mvom497	On par with standards decades ago? Do you hear yourself? Decades ago we had assets that were magnitudes less than what we have today. On top of that we have code on top of code abstracted from decades of development to get to where we are today.\n\nDo you honestly think in-house engines do anything special than what Unreal does? Because if you do then I have a bridge to sell you. \n\n\nI will try to be as nice as possible and educate you. If you aren‚Äôt using Unreal engine, you are still doing the exact same things that I described to make your in house engines perform well in the game you create as you would have forking the source code of Unreal Engine. The only difference is that you and your team built it from the ground up vs having to only modify the specific process that is causing your game to not perform well. \n\nMost all companies make their engine with one game in mind then end up branching out and trying to use that same engine for other products and almost all of them end up falling short and require years of rewriting the engine to fix what it doesn‚Äôt do well in that type of game. I already listed examples but because you ignored them:\n\nFrostbite (Anthem)\nRE Engine (Monster Hunter Wilds)	PlanZSmiles	1	2025-06-03 00:02:11	gaming	f	\N	\N	t1_mvokayh	t3_1l1mxmr	2025-06-03 00:02:23.307855

The PR hit from failing to act would be so much worse than the cost of losing a bit of product, especially when they can probably still sell most of it if it turns out to be a non-issue.

3	1l1uci2	Those of you in poorer countries, what was your gaming experience growing up? And how different or similar is it to now?	Title is a tl, Dr. The post is just an account of my own experience growing up. \n\nThis is a question I've been wondering as someone who didn't have the money to buy consoles/pcs, and even now it's all second hand stuff. \n\nIn 2014-2015 when I was around 6, my aunt gifted me my first ever console, a Playstation 2 slim. I didn't have internet access or any friends that did, so this was my first time gaming outside of an arcade. Didn't even know what an Xbox was at this point, and to me the PS2 was the latest and greatest thing ever. I remember playing some Cars game I don't remember, as well as a Ninja Turtles game I also don't remember. However I spent most of my time on on Gran Turismo 4. Since it was second hand, it didn't last very long, about a year I think. Sat without a console for a few months I believe. \n\nIn late 2015, my uncle sold his Xbox 360 S to my dad. Still didn't know about anything post 7th generation at this point. I have so many memories playing Forza Motorsport 3, Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012 and lots of other games I don't remember. This console lasted until 2017. Went without a console until 2018.\n\nIn 2018, my father surprised my brother and I with an Xbox 360 E and some new games, one of which I remember is DragonBall Z Budokai 3. Later that year, I discovered that my favourite "mobile" game was also on the 360, Minecraft. However I was stuck on TU7 since no internet and all that. It was only around this time I saw an 8th Gen console, the Xbox One S, it was not mine however, nor did I get to experience it in any way. \n\nIn late 2022, I only then discovered the 9th generation consoles. This was the same year we finally got internet installed at our house. My only experience with 8th Gen was through my cousin on his 2013 Xbox One, and he'd rarely let me play anyway. \n\nFast forward to May 2023, and my father comes home with a large box containing my first ticket to modern gaming, and Xbox One S. I was literally jumping with joy that night and couldn't wait to have my turn lmao. By this point I was 14.\n\nAnd now, at 16 almost 17, we're finally in a place where we can consider an upgrade to a second hand Series S, but that's still far away for me right now. Money is still tight and all y'know. \n\n\nSo, what was your gaming experience growing up? Bonus points if you're relatively young like I am, but have similar experiences to people older than you. \n\nSorry for the long post, just feeling super nostalgic tonight lol. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	Urmomsfavouritelol	1	0	2025-06-02 21:31:24	gaming	\N	https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l1uci2/those_of_you_in_poorer_countries_what_was_your/	f	t	2025-06-02 21:31:42.971297

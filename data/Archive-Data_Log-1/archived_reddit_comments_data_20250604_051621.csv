Im rounding up and down but only 50% of eligible voters actually vote. 20% of voters always vote for the party regardless of facts or scandals.  That leaves 10% of the population to decide an election. Basically you can write off 90% of voters and that 10% are usually pretty reasonable which is why they decide who to vote for based on the election rather than the party. Don't get me wrong I typically hate undecided voters because WTF could be more obvious than the differences between the two parties but you add in wedge issues (God, gays, guns and abortion) and its actually way more complicated to convince undecideds than one would think. End game is those 10% aren't wealthy or poor they're usually average middle class and once the reality of the financials start to come out its not that difficult to educate them about how tax policy impacts their budget and wallets. ",Pando5280,1,2025-06-04 05:03:19,news,False,,,t1_mvvob09,t3_1l2s9ok,2025-06-04 05:03:34.331099

32937,mvwg1ud,"Up to Civ 5, most of the game can be automated and you’re free to enjoy clicking hexes and making cities and making em cool and big and getting into fights up until about the prince difficulty. Civ6 takes some of the automation away but by virtue of some of the systems straight up not existing.  Civ 7 I won’t touch on because that’s a mess right now still.

By extension this can be applied to MOO2 and even gal Civ 1,2,3 (haven’t really played 4)

You can make an empire relatively easily that will take care of most of the fine tuned stuff for you.

Is it efficient?  No but it gets the job done.
Can it beat the game for you?
Also no.  Even on easier difficulties, all these games will eventually find ways to punish you.

But stellaris????

Again, I have spent a college course level of time genuinely trying to learn the ins and outs of this game.  I’ve watched YouTube videos.  I’ve plugged the difficulty down to the lowest it can be, I’ve give myself all the odds possible.

And it just never clicks.  I barely get into having more than a few colonies before I’m overwhelmed with X resource shortage, rebellion, invaders from nine different races, random events, black holes.  I’m stuck managing Mr Roboto in city 2a of colony 5C who’s been waiting six entire turns that took half an hour each for a ship carrying… something????  It’s been so long since I sent the ship out.  I remember my first few playthroughs always had me asking : Should I make an outpost?  Should I make a colony? Should I make a space station? 

The biggest Part of it is ship building, I genuinely do not care how they’re built, I don’t want to get into that aspect at all but so much of the basic aspects of the game are locked behind competent ship building.  I do not care about it one iota.  It can go be separated into an entirely different game by itself.

People call realtime action games like Hades roguelikes, and also card games like Balatro, and many of them have metaprogression that allows you to bring bonuses for your next attempts.

TLDR:
.
The only gacha game I ever liked, as well as the only Sword Art Online game I ever liked was shut down just under three years, can't remember the timeline now. I was there the first and last day. Sword Art Online Alicitization Rising Steel, which changed its name for whatever reason halfway through its life to Sword Art Online Unleash Blading. I think because the allure was the 2D/3D world map was only the first two stages, then the entire rest of the game was a super convoluted visual novel with seemingly endless dialogue. I was really pissed off about it, felt tricked, but the combat was so entertaining I kept playing until they killed it. It says everywhere you look that the developer was Bandai Namco, but they were just the publisher, and it was developed by Wright Flyer Studios, who vanished off the face of the Earth after Echoes of Mana.

32999,mvwgyxx,"Yeah, it’s a great idea to get kids talking about anger management and their emotions early on. I try to work with my nieces, but talking about it in classes, even just gym class every once in a while, would help back it up for them.

On a related note, my youngest brother had a bad temper as a kid and taking up karate was instrumental in helping him get over that. Honestly, I wish my other brother had gone, too. (He can turn into a bit of a Hulk/Mr. Hyde hybrid when he’s really angry). 

I think the mindfulness of karate and the physical control of it helped his temper the most. It also helped that he knew he didn’t want to start or get into a fight, because it wouldn’t be fair to the other person. 

On the flip side of this is the whole topic of boxing and similar sports ostensibly being used to help young men’s mental health. I’m not sure if it’s as much of a thing in the U.S., but I’ve seen it mentioned in a lot of British detective or drama shows: a show will have the gym owner or trainer say that it helps young men get out the aggression. However, I discussed this with my therapist and he said that there have been studies debunking boxing’s usefulness in mental health improvement. (I think that part of the problem there is that it doesn’t help your mental state to get your head knocked around a lot. It can take a number of times before you even feel the effects of getting your block knocked off, but by then, you’re already in trouble.)

549,1l581bj,how many people not buying a game at $70+ for the standard price to get lowered?,"games are getting stupidly expensive stupidly quickly. the nintendo that would cut their own profits to support the industry is gone. 

the only way to lower the cost is to not buy the games at this price. but how many people would it take to get that point across? how long would it take to see that change? 

the only major example in recent history i can think of was the launch 3ds dropping by $70. if that wasnt desperation i dont know what is. 

weve actually already seen some resistance. people didnt rush to buy the ps5 pro or the switch 2, theres plenty in stock. 

but aaa games are famously not profitable. maybe theyll make a small profit relative to how much was spent, but if they spent x amount making the game, they rarely would make back 2x.",Animedingo,0,2025-06-07 00:34:37,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l581bj/how_many_people_not_buying_a_game_at_70_for_the/,False,True,2025-06-07 00:34:50.923436,0,negative

it's a *goddamn multiplayer game* advertised as multiplayer, focused on multiplayer. play with your friends! play with a team! *fucking bullshit.*

then they drop a patch for multiplayer that supposedly fixes broken fucking multiplayer for questers. what about the *regular players*??? eh fromsoft???? i'm not doing remembrances i just want to *play the fucking game i paid for.*

i spent more time last night waiting to get a match than i did gaming. i was playing with a friend too, just needed *one* person to join. not doing some special remembrance quest, just trying to beat the first fucking boss.

after waiting *45 goddamn minutes* to get a 3rd person last night we gave up. tried again today and got a 3rd player just to get bounced as soon as the game loaded (see screenshot).

if fromsoft is too shitty of an organization to understand how to code multiplayer than *why release a fucking multiplayer game* you absolute asshats??? fuck you fromsoft.

but, as some one who loves single player games, i've never been more excited about games than i am right now. there are so many good games right now. my backlog has never been longer. there are some really great big budget games at the moment. my favorite genre, horror, has been absolutely flooded with great games. resident evil has been firing on all cylinders for years. silent hill made it's triumphant return. fatal frame getting remasters. the indie horror scene is absolutely popping off. there are so many great looking indie horror games now, i learn about a new one nearly every day. additionally with elden ring i got into souls/souls-likes and went back and played the older ones, but now there is a huge influx of upcoming soulslikes. and there are also so many great new game ips at the moment that i want to try. clair obscur, blue prince. 

i don't know. maybe it's just i'm in a good mood, but i feel like i'm absolutely drowning in games (in a good way). and i feel like for every game i complete i learn about 5 more i want to play.  does anyone else feel this way at the moment ?",ur2fat80,0,2025-06-07 06:19:55,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l5e2wh/ive_never_been_more_excited_for_the_future_of/,False,True,2025-06-07 06:20:15.304536,2,positive

624,1l5oij4,is there some strategy game like that? that goes extremely into detail and gives you lots of freedom but is also realistic?,"i want a game where for example (this is the scenario i have in my head rn) you're some army commander leading some troops into sieging and taking control of the city.

i want a game where everything is taken into consideration (i know it doesn't exist but at least have many things taken into consideration) for example i want to send first a recon unit (assuming the city doesn't know yet we're coming) to find out and validate the enemies numbers, both civilians and military, look into the entrances to the city and fortification, look into the resources they have available and get an estimate on how much they'll last in a siege, an estimate on the number of pigeons they have for sending messages, have the recon look into alternative ways to enter the city (broken/under construction wall part, sewer, river, black market hidden door...) and this is all in the recon phase.

later when i actually start to mobilize the army i want my army to have logistics so out of 5000 man have 500-1000 handle logistics all the way from gathering wood, food, and coal, to blacksmiths and other parts of a regular medieval army, having deserters, having to pass judgement on soliders going astray, siege craftsman and what's more...

and then starts the siege and war where i for example would block all the entrances i know of, kill the pigeons so that the city is isolated and won't get help, ect...


there's so much i can think of.

so... is there anything even close to that?

iirc, it was like a ball suspended from one or maybe a couple of arms and you could move it in any direction within a few inch diameter sphere and it would register that movement like a 3d joystick. i think it was positioned to interface with myst-like games so that you could reach into the game-world in a more natural fashion. they maybe even had one game that supported it.

it must have never really gotten off the ground as it's so hard to find even a mention of it now. but i've been curious about it recently and was hoping to find a picture and more details about what it really was.

694,1l67td7,deathloop. wow. borderline hated this game.,"finally beat this game (\~21 hours) after it sat in my backlog for a couple years. i heard at launch that it had a pretty mixed reception, but after loving dishonored 1 and 2 and prey, i thought i'd finally check it out.

this game sucks. 

it's boring, tedious, uneventful, full of backtracking, too easy, some of the worst ai you'll see in a game, and just a massive slog.

unfortunately i have a condition that compels me to see every game through to the credits, and man, this game was an absolute chore. and the last couple hours are borderline disrespectful with a sequence forcing you to visit several areas repeatedly just to unlock a new area.

if i was to give this game a rating it'd be 6/10. it's only that high due to the incredible art design, music, and voiceover work. if i was rating it based on sheer gameplay, this would be a 3-4/10.

i'm generally not one to be a conspiracy theorist (paid review etc), but i genuinely cannot understand a reviewer giving this game a 10. it's unreal. at best, this game is a low 7. like, with all the dishonored-esque powers, it just seems like a waste of time to play ""creatively"" when i can just walk around and headshot every enemy with a silenced smg. if i, the player, need to ""find the fun"", then i think the devs failed.

  
anyways, i hope i save someone's time from not playing deathloop. ughh.",squirrelyz,0,2025-06-08 09:06:30,gaming,Unknown,https://i.redd.it/34e81toa4o5f1.jpeg,False,False,2025-06-08 09:06:43.243905,0,negative

711,1l6axmk,need some game recommendations for a non-gaming retiree!,"my retired dad’s expressed an interest in getting into gaming, but it’s a real trek.

when i asked him his favorite game, he said “there’s an old train game from the 90’s, there’s no graphics, but it’s a complicated game managing railway scheduling, and it’s only being maintained by ‘some guy in germany.’” i’ve looked it up and confirmed it’s this odd game called “bahn,” lovingly preserved in [this corner of the legacy html internet](  we may need to build an older system to get it running. pic related.

he’s never been a gamer. he actually watches rdr2 no-talking environmental videos every single day, and used to want to try assassin's creed black flag. i got him an 8bitdo controller after reading [this excellent article]( but it hasn't been of much help. it seems **button combinations are too daunting**, which is fair.

the journey so far:

* i got him a switch, as he said he wanted to try playing 'mario.' got a few mario games like wonder and odyssey, and none of them clicked.
* he used to love railroad simulator games and has some very expensive controller buried in storage. i'm working on fishing that out for him.
* i got him a recent railway simulator game, but it involved navigating a 3d world and it was too tricky for him. 
* my wife will play rdr1 and let him decide where to go and what to do, which he enjoys. but i can tell he also wants to try something himself, but rdr is way above his dexterity level and he'd rather just watch the playthroughs. 
* he has an actual goal, he wants to work up to learning overcooked, so he can play with his grandson, my nephew.
* i showed him dave the diver, and while it's the exact aesthetic he likes, the actual gameplay is too tricky. 
* i asked him about his favorite game, which led me to ask here for suggestions.

i have a feeling he might like some of the ‘spreadsheet simulators’ or something logic/systems-oriented, with no complex controls, moderately complex systems, low stakes and nothing time-oriented. it feels like an odd mix of casual /hyper-specific to get started.

he's far more comfortable with a mouse and keyboard rather than a controller.

717,1l6cke9,just getting to your destination feels epic death stranding,"and its because of what it was initially criticized for: a walking sim.

having to balance your cargo based on your weight with l2 & r2, while keeping an eye on the terrain to make sure you don't trip keeps me in the moment in a way no other open world rpg does, imo. 

it makes traversal feel like an actual journey instead of just pushing forward on auto pilot. 

then there's the cinematic beat moments with music kojima layers on top of the journey that is just the chefs kiss on the whole thing.

the first time i got to port knot city and  made my downhill descent as the music kicked in - after hours of delivering packages, dodging bt's, fighting mules and dealing with the wind farm - it just made for this moment  where it all clicked and had me completely hooked. its hard to describe without experiencing it.

and ""keep on keeping on"" is now a mantra i repeat to myself that has literally helped me see some tough things through irl. 

kojima really knows how to make his games impactful, if nothing else.

**i'd love to hear what your favorite mech game is, and what you think is so great about it.  i'm always looking for new inspirations for cards, abilities, and enemies!**

exoterra is a co-op campaign game where players take on the role of pilots of giant mechs, called jackets. throughout the campaign, players will customize their jacket's arsenal, which is a deck of cards made up from the jacket, gear, and vendor cards you slowly acquire. in a session, players will go into a sortie where they battle other cunning jacket pilots and complete mission objectives.

the enemy pilots are cunning and deadly - each a unique puzzle. they will develop and grow in power based on the players' actions and choices, as will the campaign itself.  


happy to share more about exoterra if you're interested!  you can find a preview on kickstarter and a bunch of developer diaries on its boardgamegeek page.

831,1l6uani,xboxos is huge even if you only play games on a desktop. here's why.,"a quick info dump on why steamos is so good currently: it's drops everything to run games.

that's it. that's the secret.

steamos is just a pre-packaged arch linux that launches into a gamescope session instead of the desktop and runs next-to-nothing in the background when in that gamescope session.

now, i want you to ask yourself: what if windows could do that?

what if windows could launch a console-style ui that is self-contained and completely alone with no processes like onedrive, office, or copilot to eat performance.

what if i told you it's already possible because of xbox consoles?

xbox consoles run just like steamos, but with windows as a base. they use a system called ""hyperland"" to give each game their own self-contained virtual machine. this means no kernel level anticheat. this means no background processes to eat at performance. this is also how quick resume works. you're just saving the state of the hyperland vm for that game and recalling it when you start it back up.

i genuinely believe the new xbox handhelds are just running windows with a custom hyperland session. windows kills itself in favor of this hyperland session, and the games launch in their own sessions.

this is huge, and as a linux fanboy i'm very, **very** excited.

to think that we're getting what is basically steamos's performance and security with windows compatibility is a **massive** win.",Kragwulf,0,2025-06-09 03:02:29,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l6uani/xboxos_is_huge_even_if_you_only_play_games_on_a/,False,True,2025-06-09 03:02:41.219382,2,positive

846,1l708to,the current developing situation makes gamepass absolutely offputting to me.,"with the recent news of the outer worlds 2 being 80 bucks has more or less cemented my view of gamepass as scummy.

they already did this with avowed, where they took (what imo is) a great game (that should have been like 50 bucks), overpriced it to high heaven and then put it out for sale. the idea being that if you buy the game, you spend way more than it should cost, or you pay for the subscription to a service xbox needs to be successful.

now, i don't know how good or ""valuable"" the outer worlds 2 will be. if it will be worth an 80$ pricetag (i doubt it, very few if any games are) or not...

but the idea of xbox essentially going ""yeah, you can either buy this game at extreme markup, or pay for gamepass, prove us right, come oooon\~"" really puts me off and i can't help but see it as extremely toxic and really weird.

it just feels as an greedy excuse to make games more expensive for no reason beyond ""they will pay anything for this"".

i am not sure what everyone else thinks about it, but as someone that already thought gamepass wasn't a favorable option, this essential ""forcing"" of it just makes me dislike it even more.",Tnecniw,0,2025-06-09 09:20:55,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l708to/the_current_developing_situation_makes_gamepass/,False,True,2025-06-09 09:21:21.369985,0,negative

i upgraded my pc overtime and finally ended up with my 4070 s dream build after swapping many average gpus overtime and saving the money time and time again. it was literally my dream as a child that i made true finally.

now i was able to play all the games with the most amazing output/performance finally in my life. but, the good days short lived.

recently i started having stutters in all the games. my major parts are new and i was unable to pinpoint which of the parts is at fault now. finally i was exhausted after troubleshooting loads of problems over the years. i can't invest any bit of energy and a single dime on my pc anymore.

ended up renting a ps5 to test it before buying one for me to finally put an end to my gaming problems. couldn't take any more stress regarding my pc.

902,1l7cgma,"as a playstation player, i do have a few ideas for xbox to be more successful.","personally, it may not be the most popular or commonly used feature of the controllers, but the motion and touchpad features on the ps controllers should be new universal addition imo. they literally add and don't take away. while not a lot of games have them, those who do know how to make it work very well, especially warframe (swiping for powers) and helldivers 2 (still aiming with the right stick, but also slightly adjusting with motion; can be toggled).

however, there's a more important feature i think would allow them to be more preferred, as sony just won't do this while xbox is owned by a pc company: console single-player modding. i heard some games might/may add it to ps, but might be rumors as far as i know. games should be treated as entertainment that people enjoy however they want, especially single player games (multiplayer games can use visual mods, but if there's a way to toggle if others can see or not, that could be cool... like nude mods). modding is no different from buying a car and changing the rims or adding a spoiler. when i played basketball with my friends, we never played like it's the nba, but played ""horse"" (mimick the other with the ball or add a letter; all letters = you lose).

mouse and keyboard is on both consoles, but while i'm not sure how it is on xbox (all, some, probably actually none for some reason...), some games on playstation 5 does allow it, namely warframe and the first descendant. need to try it on helldivers 2.",NLK-3,0,2025-06-09 18:29:58,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l7cgma/as_a_playstation_player_i_do_have_a_few_ideas_for/,False,True,2025-06-09 18:30:19.908846,1,neutral

911,1l7dvnk,should i avoid buying digital indie games from the eshop for the switch if i don't agree with nintendo's decisions for the switch 2?,"so, as it stands, i have been dealing with regular issues in both of my elbows due to cubital tunnel, as well as tendonitis in my right arm and shoulder. i have been experimenting frequently, and so far, the switch is still the most comfortable way for me to experience video games at this time. physical therapy has done nothing to help my condition, for the record, and i'm not willing to get surgery since there's a chance it won't even work. 

having said that, i don't personally agree with many of nintendo's decisions in regards to the switch 2 release. some of their practices that rub me wrong in particular include their updated eula agreements, their refusal to correct the joycon drift problem, mandatory online connection for basic functions, game key cards for third party developers, and their hostile targeting of independent development teams with projects that are vaguely similar to their own ips and patents. 

it gets to the point where i don't even know if it would be right for me to continue using the original switch and supporting indie devs on that platform, even if it is the most comfortable way for me to continue gaming. i've tried other systems like playstation, xbox, pc and even the steam deck, and each of them have their own little issues that aggravate my symptoms in one way or another. it makes the dilemma even worse knowing that the eshop servers are doomed to shut down at some point, even if that's been extended slightly due to the switch 2 release. 

i just can't decide on what the right thing for me to do is anymore. i genuinely enjoy many of the other third party console exclusives, and tend to get their first party games physically and for a good prince online whenever possible. so i want to explore the matter further here and am open to any input you guys may have on the matter. thanks.",mean_emcee,0,2025-06-09 19:24:26,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l7dvnk/should_i_avoid_buying_digital_indie_games_from/,False,True,2025-06-09 19:24:36.173777,0,negative

923,1l7fldg,gaming needs to understand economics,"i'm getting yelled at on r/steam for saying i'll pay $80 for outer worlds 2, calling me a sucker and that i'm just helping fatcats buy yachts.

i'm a social democrat. i vote for bernie. aoc is my favorite politician. i genuinely think corporate greed is a huge problem. but there's a widespread problem of people letting ""corporate greed"" just be a thought-terminating cop-out to avoid confronting economic realities.

skilled game developers and 3d artists cost $100k+/yr. to employ. 4k aaa games require massive teams of them to produce — far more than games a couple of decades ago. many, many games wind up losing money. the biggest expense for game studios by far is paying regular staff. a ps1 game in 2025 dollars would be approaching $100, and those needed far fewer people to make.

i'm getting into serious indie game dev myself lately and want to see a lot more games that don't have these massive sorts of budgets, though we are talking about outer worlds 2, here, which, if anything like its predecessor, will be truly fantastic game, not just more codslop or another madden game or whatever.

we should have more games that don't have photorealistic 4k graphics and are priced appropriately. i hate microtransactions and lootboxes. i'm not saying you should pay $80 for something that nickel and dimes you more after you buy the game.

but it's simply unrealistic in 2025 for a game to be all of the following:  
\- aaa 4k graphics  
\- high quality story & gameplay  
\- no extractive monetization  
\- cost $60 or less at launch",ExistentialEnso,0,2025-06-09 20:29:56,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l7fldg/gaming_needs_to_understand_economics/,False,True,2025-06-09 20:30:22.046835,1,neutral

946,1l7jr9o,why not nintendo on other platforms?,"so with the switch 2 just released and the xbox showcase showcasing games being released on xbox and playstation, i'm back to thinking about why nintendo won't release their exclusives on other platforms.

why not have a separate launcher on pc where they can sell games and their subscriptions on there? or sell on xbox and ps stores? even if it was a timed release a year after being released on their console. the earnings on their big players like mario, zelda, and pokemon would be immense especially compared to their console sales. consoles generally break even and the companies make money on the games. especially with how they price their games.

they spend so much time and money fighting emulators, when it could all be avoided if they released the game officially themselves to avoid the headache.

is it an ethos thing? a control thing? old school way of thinking/operating? help me understand. there's obviously something i'm missing.

949,1l7kh2s,the best gaming experience of my life (journey),"i don’t remember exactly when journey came out, but i remember seeing a preview and thinking it looked interesting. i had never played anything from that developer before, but something about it stood out. so the day it launched, i downloaded it and jumped in.

no menu screen, no hud just dropped right into the game. and man, it was absolutely gorgeous right from the start. i took my time wandering through the early levels, just soaking everything in. at some point, i came into this open area and started exploring. out of nowhere, i heard this little noise. then again. i realized it was another character. at this point i didn't even know this was a multiplayer game.

the only way to communicate in this game was with these little chirps your character could make, either a quick one or a longer, stronger one if you held the button down. no voice chat. nothing else. and somehow, it was perfect. me and this random person just started exploring together, figuring out the simple puzzles the game throws at you. it didn’t take long before we were totally in sync, using just these little chirps. we started to figure out a rhythm and a system, and it actually felt like we were communicating better than in most co op games with full voice chat.

we ended up doing the whole game together. start to finish. we wandered through all these beautiful environments, helped each other out, solved everything as a team. if you’ve played journey, you know how the ending is, it hits hard. it’s beautiful, emotional, sad, and uplifting all at once.

but the moment that really stuck with me was after the credits rolled. the game shows you the username of the person you played with, and mine was someone with a full kanji name. japanese, most likely didn’t speak english. and that’s when it hit me, if we’d had voice chat, we probably wouldn’t have made it past the first area. we wouldn’t have understood each other, probably would’ve just left.

that game showed me that words aren’t always the best way to communicate. there are so many ways to understand and connect with people if you’re open to it. that little experience over a decade ago honestly changed how i see a lot of things in life. it made me more patient, more understanding, and more willing to figure people out even if we don’t speak the same language literally or figuratively.

anyway, i’ve told this story to a few friends over the years, but i figured it was time to share it with people who might really appreciate it. that experience will always stick with me.",Sparklefresh,0,2025-06-09 23:55:52,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l7kh2s/the_best_gaming_experience_of_my_life_journey/,False,True,2025-06-09 23:56:19.058957,2,positive

when castlevania for the nes came out in 1987 it was $40 (roughly $113 in 2025 dollars).

when streets of rage 2 for the genesis came out in 1992 it was $50 ($114 in 2025 dollars).

when street fighter 2 for the snes came out in 1992 it was $70 ($160 in 2025 dollars). granted, this was about the highest priced cartridge game (not counting neogeo) at the time.

when resident evil for the ps1 came out in 1996 it was $50 ($102 in 2025 dollars).

when goldeneye 007 for the n64 came out in 1997 it was $70 ($140 in 2025 dollars). again, about the most expensive cartridge game.

when metal gear solid 2 for the ps2 came out in 2001 it was $50 ($90 in 2025 dollars).

when nba2k2 came out for the dreamcast/gc/ps2/xbox in 2001 it averaged $50-60 on all systems ($90-108 in 2025 dollars).

when red dead redemption came out for the ps3 in 2010, it was $60 ($88 in 2025 dollars).

ps3 and xbox360 games set the new price for an average disc-based game at $60 up from $50 where it had been since ps1.


aaa titles at $80 are still the cheapest that they've ever been, and i think gaming media (like most media) is just trying to piss you off.

965,1l7nryr,mario kart world is mario kart at its absolute best,"mario kart world is the best mario kart yet. 

(it’s not my personal favorite though, mk64 wins there)

the gameplay is so refined. the tight controls feel great and natural. the graphics are bright, fast, and beautiful. the game also feels a lot more fair than other mario karts - with less lucky wins/losses and much more skill-based. 

is it worth the price of a switch 2 and the game? no, it’s not. but obviously other games will be released, so thinking of it like that doesn’t make much sense. 

the worst part of mario kart world is the missed opportunity of the open world. it’s just weak and lacks incentive. that being said, nintendo created such a refined game that even though the open world is meh, it’s still fun enough.

971,1l7q8vf,journey - experientially sublime.,"fortuitous timing - i just saw another post about journey earlier today and i had just finished it myself.

tl;dr play journey.  i'll just be up front about it.

it would be convenient to simply say journey transcends video game genres - i've said it myself - but upon reflection that's not entirely true.  similar to how electroplankton served more as a musical experience, journey reimagines the adventure genre as an *experience*.

no doubt, pushing against genre boundaries is 100% a gamble, but when that gamble pays off, players are rewarded with magical moments that stir things at a deeper level.  say what you will about skyward sword, lanayru desert *excelled* at evoking a sense of desolation and ruin.

enter journey.  this was my first time through.  the only objective (if you will) is to proceed forward.  each segment is simply a movement - an orchestration - from its beginning to its end.  the only real choice is the precise path to take, but just as a day begins and a day ends - you're arriving at midnight one way or the other - how are you going to spend your time?

and i think that's a key point.  in life, there's one opportunity each day to pause, for instance, and appreciate the sunset.  each segment in journey likewise provides space for emotional appeal and whether you capitalize on that is entirely up to you, but pausing and letting the sounds and visuals wash over you is part of what makes journey great.  the camera nudges you to do so, and i encourage it as well (especially in real life).

i tend to overlap many different games at the same time and ended up playing journey over the course of months - often just one segment at a time - and it was still neat to have other journeyers pop in.  this again mirrors life where people can pop in and out to encourage you along the way, if in no other way than by simply being present.  i can totally see how sharing most, if not all, of the adventure with a single companion would be even more evocative.  (my most recent companion is shown in the above photo, fighting the harsh winds with me.)

definitely a recommended experience.

980,1l7sznz,"dune: awakening is going to be huge. kudos devs, truly...","this isnt the usual, ""praise the devs"" post, or a typical ""review the game"".  i actually had a bit of an epiphany this week.

i am 44, been playing games since i was 6, when i started on a bbc electron playing citadel. 

so, in all that time, in all the 100's of games, i have been trying to remember if i have ever, and i mean ever, enjoyed a game as much as i have dune: awakening.

the only thing that comes close was my first mmo, back in 2007, which was world of warcraft. i was in the army and a mate introduced me to it and then we went in 3 weeks leave and i swear i barely left the block in that whole time.

so yeah, after 80 hours in da since thursday (i know, but i took a week off for it), i think this is the first time in 20 years i have truly found something that compares.

now i cannot stress this next part enough, and i really really hope one of them reads this.

kudos to the devs.

the work ethic on display in this game is truly next level and hopefully sets a new standard. one we haven't really seen since covid. 

covid messed up a lot of things, and i feel game development is one of them given how long games take to ship. most aaa games will have been affected.

but i feel we have become so used to mediocrity. devs now seem less ambitious, less innovative.

look another open world rpg, very similar to other open worlders. another soulslike. another survival game. another extraction shooter. on and on and on. some good, some less so, but nothing really standing out even if some people convinve themselves it has.

this game da though. it innovates. it breaks new boundaries. every mechanic is meaningfull. every gameplay aspect is useful. i just can't do it justice here, but the amount of work and passion this game must have taken to reach this state, and keep it there over launch has hit me.

funcom developers and joel the madman, deserve all the success this game will have. i can only imagine the effort.

i feel like the sleeper, being awakened. i was starting to think i was maybe over gaming, but now i realise gaming had gone stagnant and that ""next big game"" i gave been chasing and not finding for years, has finally just arrived.
 

tldr: devs are great, i am a shill, blah blah, this is possibly the best game i have played in 40 years of gaming. yeah i didnt mean to write so much.",OnlyBans1981,0,2025-06-10 07:55:08,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l7sznz/dune_awakening_is_going_to_be_huge_kudos_devs/,False,True,2025-06-10 07:55:33.019513,2,positive

985,1l7u7od,"[rant] can developers (aaa, aa, even indie to a degree) please have more variety?","this is a rant and i needed to blow off some steam after seeing this but i just saw a new atari adventure game is releasing.... and it's a metroidvania.... despite the fact that the series before was basically just top-down adventure stuff before zelda did it... and the og sequel turned into swordquest.... and the closest thing to an actual official sequel was in tribute to the original. where does the metroidvania element fit into this series? maybe as a spin-off or idk a sorta similar vein to zelda 2 but honestly to me the idea just sounds like what happened with yars revenge and beyond the ice palace (obscure british 80s game which got a sequel this year) where both were a shooter and action platformer respectively and just got turned into yet-another-metroidvania. it's like they're being gentrified into the new hot genres. surely there's a market for shooters. i wouldn't mind ice palace so much either because you can turn a 2d action platformer into a metroidvania for the sequel but i'm pretty sure nothing about the sequel is carried from the original. the main character looks completely different and i don't know if you can get any of the weapons from the first game. maybe you can but from what i saw you start out the game with a whip, just like castlevania. 

please, devs! there's more to 2d games than metroidvanias, at least cinematic platformers seem to be making kind of a comeback? only action 2d platformer that isn't a metroidvania releasing i can think of is the new ninja gaiden though, at least on a major scale. i've seen people talk about how there's a good flow of metroidvanias but i just saw the sub and there's like a new trailer for a new metroidvania every few days.

i get indies have a lot of weirder titles releasing that can't really fit into a genre, but still i think that many indies just seem to follow in similar paths to each other when making something that isn't really a totally unique thing. the weird thing is i don't think i've seen anybody else recently also be kinda fed-up with metroidvanias. maybe i'm just a minority but to me, somebody who only really liked classic style 2d platformers for the longest time, it still stinks to me that those kinds of games have been shafted in recent memory for metroidvanias. i like a few mvs though don't get me wrong. still i wish for more variety and if you're going to revive a classic franchise, either stick to the original genre, characters, whatever, or refine them to be something similar. then again zelda 2 was essentially the same boat as adventure now. i dunno, please just shake things up more, adventure was just another straw on my came's back broken a few times already.

now for the maybe less divisive one but this sgf i think people are starting to get fatigued with soulslikes and maybe rpg mechanics too. feels like they kinda took over and now combat in games if it isn't something like hack and slash action rpg will be soulslike. you'd be hard pressed to find a classic hack-and-slash. plus wasn't it expedition 33 got so much attention in part because it was a decently large scale game that used turn-based mechanics? to be fair, ff7 remake did as well but still. i can't really speak so much on these because i don't care much for aaa but i'd still love for more variety when seeing games. death of portable might have something to do with it i think. usually you got the weirder games on those devices but since the switch the focus seems to be on hybrid gameplay, and so modern handhelds basically just run what consoles can now, and exceptions are mostly like the evercade where it's entirely retro. another genre i don't care much for but online multiplayer games seem to be following a blend. rather infamously though because alot seem to fail. i think multiplayer fps games don't need to be entirely balanced for competitive stuff. i get there's money in it but honestly i think focusing too much on that restricts creative freedom. tf2 is my favourite online shooter and is probably the only one nowadays with stupid party bullshit and honestly i think more games should do that. i think a shooter with an inherently more chaotic, decentralised, casual experience like tf2 could flourish. or even, if you wanna go to the far-end of the chaotic unbalanced spectrum, half-life deathmatch, or ricochet if you wanna go crazy with it and just just shooting people. just a modern open ""fuck about on a map with other people while all trying to kill each other like a 90s lan party"" would honestly probably be a game i'd pick up

to me, the problem with these would be like if every movie released with the same cinematography and plot lines. it'd get boring. to be fair alot of them are though, but still i'd argue movies are still more experimental. there's plenty of sources to base your games from, so why just metroid and castlevania? there's alot of different ways you can do combat in a 3d environment, so why just like dark souls? i can't think of one for multiplayer fps games, just wanna see a dev go crazy with either stupid ideas or a balanced-ish game with some crazy bullshit thrown in.",BloxedYT,0,2025-06-10 09:20:07,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l7u7od/rant_can_developers_aaa_aa_even_indie_to_a_degree/,False,True,2025-06-10 09:20:29.895748,0,negative

1000,1l7x2gf,why is witch-hunting such a common behaviour in gaming communities?,"i think i don't have to explain what that means, but throughout playing games since the old n64-days, i've seen harassments-related activities being synonymous with gaming spaces, and also one of the frequently brought-up reasons from many non-gamers i've met before, including younger parents who find a reason to prohibit their children from playing video games beyond a ""just 10 - 30 minute rule"".

from my own experience (of observation), it usually happens due to one or combining factors - different playstyles between people but some people can't accept that, different ways to solve an in-game challenge but one particular method being considered the ""norm"", in highly-competitive games especially there's always someone trying to make up the ""rule"" of a game in terms of what is a meta-vs-non-meta or what is considered as ""acceptable gameplay""; although in all types of games i've played, this has always occurred as long as someone has some strong opinion and feels a certain need to control others.

i don't want to generalize, because i know that's not really intelligent to do, in the first place, but it's a common pattern i've seen that witch-hunting or at least some form of harassment targeting another player, are usually started by people who think they have been slighted on a personal level in some shape or form when it comes to ""gameplay"" or they have something to lose from the video game, or they are just (psychopathically) trolling. i know in competitive spaces like league of legends (i know, overused example, but bear with me), if you pick a infamous champion, like yasuo, you are more likely to be targeted by others than if you would use another champion that less people care about. they target you due to a choice-of-preference, and then it evolves into personal hatred, anyway. in other games with more dynamic systems allowing player-expression, if you'd play in a way that is unconventional and somehow works; that means you're winning but they're losing, and they're going to get mad. is it fair to say that they'd be witch-hunting you simply because of your style or because you're winning?

in most reasons i see being used are usually one of few arguments, like the ""it's the culture"" / ""it's how we do things here"" argument; which honestly just grate my ears. it's coming from the perspective that the ""norm"" of an environment is the rule, which i know it's not true, especially in actually rule-driven places like mmos, where the player-moderation has a clearly defined set of rules for people to follow; like ffxiv, for example, where ""enforcing a certain manner of play"" is actually a breach of tos, and can actually get you in trouble with the gms. you still get people trying to think otherwise, however, and seem to think their opinion is the rule simply because the crowd follows it. i've seen as well that in communities like these, witch-hunting is much more subtle and ""underground""; in that you won't see it coming until you realise it. i know that part of it is due to the witch-hunting parties actively trying to avoid the eyes of the gms.

other reasons include emotionally-driven ones, like anger at losing at someone's way of play; which i can understand somewhat. everyone's built different, some of us are good at dealing with certain tactics and terrible at dealing with others; but this is more like a skill-issue than anything. these people don't want to learn to solve problems; they want people around them to conform to their inability to solve a problem. they want the world to serve them, not the other way around. i want to say that this is a crybaby-mentality, but the problem is that whenever i say that; i get called toxic. however, it is apparently not-toxic for them to harass others over their playstyle; so i end up calling them hypocrites; and i get called toxic, anyway. apparently i am toxic for calling-out others' toxicity.

ultimately, i think my concern is just that modern gaming especially, hasn't exactly been a great space anymore. i mean, it kind of used to be? if you didn't like a place; you'd just go elsewhere. these days, it's not that simple anymore. i think gaming as it is currently, teaches some really bad moralities; the kind that you'd expect in a double-faced world like politics. we're starting to get people who think the real-world works like how gaming communities propagate some of the frankly speaking terrible harassment tactics gamers can use. well okay, the real-world can be much more brutal, but that's not the point.

anyway, old gamer rant. both pvp and pve games have became equally disastrous in terms of community moralities, and it is the reason why i've started playing more singleplayer / singleplayer-modes. the vast amount of time (these days) i spent in working industry has opened my eyes to the fact that gamers are not what some people like to call ""better than non-gamers""; gamer really aren't. moralities have became screwed, because modern communities hail-up twisted behaviours as role-models, and actual community-serving ones as ulterior and ripe for the taking (of harassment). every single time i see a witch-hunt, it's because of a difference in gameplay, and nothing-at-all to do with the actual person at all.",PoppySickleSticks,0,2025-06-10 12:09:28,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l7x2gf/why_is_witchhunting_such_a_common_behaviour_in/,False,True,2025-06-10 12:09:50.365569,0,negative

i recently joined a bunch of friends (we are 4 or 5) who had a ""nostalgia attack"" and decided to play ogame for a while, just for the laughs. we played for a month or so and we eventually dropped the game, because we are all 30+ y.o. and have other stuff to do.

the main problem was that another player and i (him more than me), actually put in several more hours than our other friends. so they felt quite far behind, and we got a bit bored.

i've been looking for similar games to play with them, that doesn't require that level of commitment. first i took a look at the other gameforge games but, well... they are not very good or they are dupes of others games i know.

then i looked for games that i had played several years ago (the old reliable ones), but let's say they haven't aged very well, or are quite complex, or simply no longer exist (tribal wars, travian, erepublik, etc.).

1030,1l82v1z,"stealth archers shouldn't be the only archers. where is rapid fire athletic dodge archer legolas, or 3 arrow shotgun burst robinhood?","games constantly insist that archers be snipers, sitting at incredible range in sleath and one shorting enemies. this often makes archers the best class in a game (baulder's gate and skyrim immediately come to mind). this creates a few problems, most notibly the well known ""every character is a stealth archer"" situation bethesda games suffer from.

but the issue here isn't necessary that sleath archer is too good, it's that there isn't even another way to play an archer available. games don't even attempt to offer an alternative, often making all perks/abilities for archers tied to stealth and range.

but there are other possibilities such as:

*increased foreign speed can make a mid range archer great, giving it an advantage out of stealth by simply being able to put out more damage by firing more arrows quickly.

*firing multiple arrows in spread like a shotgun to deal burst damage at close range.

*adding notching an arrow to movement, for instance, dodging or jumping with a bow automatically notches and pulls back and arrow so you can dodge and counterattack.

*utility like wire traps, sharpenel/explosive arrows, or grappling.

there are so many more ways to allow players to play an archer in videogames, but the popularity of bethesda's stealth archer has convinced the entire industry that it's the way to create archers in videogames and offering alternatives is a waste of development time and resources.

bows aren't guns. imo, in a fantasy or medieval game a bow should be a bow, not a sniper rifle. and if it can be used like a sniper rifle (bc yes stealth archer can be fun), then at least give it other uses and optional play styles.

i'd like to see this change in the industry. here a few games that i think provide better archery: monster hunter where archers are mid/close range acrobatic dodge dancers, overwatch where hanzo is a wall climbing stratigist that can only snipe from range if you have expectional aim due to not being able to zoom in like a sniper rifle, bioshock where the crossbow has different bolts that explode or create electric wire traps and is used for its utility.",CannibalRed,0,2025-06-10 16:14:51,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l82v1z/stealth_archers_shouldnt_be_the_only_archers/,False,True,2025-06-10 16:15:17.410922,1,neutral

1055,1l89ba8,i beat chrono trigger for the first time. it lived up to the hype and then some.,"released in 1995 and created by a dream team consisting of hironobu sakaguchi (creator of final fantasy), yuji horii (creator of dragon quest), and akira toriyama (r.i.p; creator of dragon ball), chrono trigger is often considered one of the greatest games of all time, and one, if not the, greatest jrpg of all time. i finally learned why that is, and i was an emotional wreck by the end, crying and clapping.

the narrative:

chrono trigger’s narrative structure is based on time travel, where the player and their allies will travel to various historical epochs, ranging from the prehistoric to a dystopian future. the main character, crono, and his allies must travel to multiple points in time to thwart an apocalyptic entity. during these trips to these periods, crono will encounter many different allies. aided by its themes of sacrifice, friendship, and existential redemption, chrono trigger’s narrative transcends the boundaries of interactive storytelling. furthermore, chrono trigger gives the player a massive amount of agency with multiple endings, and nearly every choice has a consequence; some minor, some major. various endings create a non-linear narrative experience, enhancing replay value. while most games nowadays offer different endings and try to give the player some agency in one way or another, chrono trigger pioneered in that regard. a significant deviation (and one that i loved) was the removal of random encounters, something that was incredibly atypical for games of the jrpg genre during that time. the game gives the player more autonomy in navigating the world by showing the enemy on screen in the environment. chrono trigger also offers a ng+ mode, allowing players to experience different possibilities, such as different endings, and even the option to avoid obtaining certain party members.

what i loved most about the game was all the themes it presented throughout my 32-hour run. the game explores themes such as free will, fate, choice, life, death and rebirth, the complex relationship humanity has with technology, the power of friendship and how it can help overcome challenges, reconciliation and forgiveness, environmentalism, despair, and hope.

the visuals and the music:

the distinctive visuals, created by the wonderful akira toriyama, contribute to the game’s everlasting appeal. each historical epoch is meticulously crafted and breathtaking, from the landscapes of 1000 ad to the dystopian, desolate, barren wastelands of 2300 ad (my favourite era in the game). complementing the incredible visuals is the fantastic soundtrack, primarily orchestrated by yasunori mitsuda and nobuo uematsu. music can serve as a narrative device that amplifies emotional resonance and augments thematic depths. chrono trigger excelled in this regard; there’s a reason its soundtrack is often regarded as one of the greatest in video game history. the soundtrack features iconic songs such as “frog’s theme,” “corridors of time,” and “to far away times.”

what would a game be without its characters?

chrono trigger offers a host of amazing characters, each with incredible emotional depth and complexity. frog, for example, embodies redemption through his internal and external struggles, while robo’s narrative explores the philosophy of identity, humanity, and free will. lucca, the lovely little genius, embodies gender defiance; she is a powerful female character. she is not a princess or a healer; she is a strong, brilliant, capable fighter dressed in practical rather than feminine attire. lucca embodies the pursuit of knowledge and the spirit of human ingenuity. my favourite character, marle, is one kick ass woman. while she struggles with her identity and role as a princess, she is strong-willed and optimistic; her real name, nadia, can be translated to hope in various languages. even when it is not always popular, she will challenge authority and always do what she believes is right. marle embodies love, hope, and emotional resilience.

recently got the itch to get back into it so i gave violet a shot and man my hype died fast. the intro felt rough: choppy transitions, sometime awkward camera angles, i walked through a particularly bushy spot just outside my house and the game stuttered and it did evrytime i went back and forth lol. everything just seemed unpolished. also i don't know why but in violet's case, it felt weird not to hear a single dialogue, not even grunts, chuckles or one-liners like you usually hear in jrpgs. the silence was jarring.

it's painfully noticeable that this is a port of a mobile game adapted to pc. especially from the unresponsive controls on the menu, which, surprise surprise, are much better manageable with mouse and keyboard than joystick, because they were designed originally with a touchscreen in mind. after some research it turns out that this is indeed a port of a mobile game, without the gacha elements and turned into a souls like of some sorts. it used to be called solo leveling arise but they added the overdrive to make it a standalone version from the gacha game. i'll be honest. the game...absolutely sucks. the story feels inexistent, the gameplay is kinda satisfying but the scenarios and characters feel very uninspired and soulless. it just failed to pull me in. even if some of the gameplay elements are satisfactory, there is nothing of substance to be enjoyed in here story-wise. the leveling up system is inefficient, the weapon crafting and switching feels unnecessary, and the bosses can be easily beaten ignoring all these mechanics and just having good parrying skills. it's a very low quality gacha mobile game ported to pc and will probably be sold full price when it comes out. i wouldn't buy the full version.",Napalmaniac,0,2025-06-11 09:56:02,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l8ondb/played_the_solo_leveling_arise_overdrive_demo_and/,False,True,2025-06-11 09:56:27.254879,0,negative

1131,1l8qcxk,looking for a game for my younger sister,"hi r/gaming! hoping to get some ideas and suggestions from you all.

i have a younger sister who is 10. i see alot of myself in her, especially when it comes to school/studying.  
i struggled in subjects that i couldn't see a use for. for example, i skipped every religion lesson simply because i thought it was pointless (not saying religion is pointless).  
subject where i could find real life applications for or that i was interested in were a breeze.

she is the same. she's ahead in almost all subjects but she sucks at math.  
she playes video games quite a lot and can speak better english than swedish (we're swedish) since she knows that she has to be able to speak english to play with other people in her games.  
math she simply doesn't see a use for since she can always grab her phone and ask siri math questions. so she finds it pointless.

last weekend i was visiting my parents. i hid her phone and told her i was curious about horses (which she loves). i asked her how much it would cost to feed a horse for a month. so we googled how much they eat per 100kg of horse, how much they weigh, and how much the food costs.  
she's able to do the calculations with just a tiny bit of help. but if it was not about horses she would find no point in doing it and she'd find it difficult.

hence this post.  
i want to find a game that requires the use of math. i'm not looking for a math game, but rather a game where you need to use math.  
i've played a bunch of path of exile where you need to use a bit of math here and there but that's obviously a much too complicated game for her. but just to give an example.  
she only plays vr so unfortunately most pc/console games won't work.

hope you guys can give me some suggestions!",floppish,0,2025-06-11 11:36:56,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l8qcxk/looking_for_a_game_for_my_younger_sister/,False,True,2025-06-11 14:45:56.149931,2,positive

1170,1l92lvs,the “open world paradox”,"starting primarily during the era of the 360/ps3 with games like red dead redemption, oblivion, skyrim, and the like, there’s been a sharp rise in the number  of open world game being produced, and it’s drastically changed the gaming landscape as a whole. elden ring, horizon, final fantasy 7 rebirth, modern assassin’s creed games, breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom, etc etc., we all know the games. hell, it’s so widespread that, as i’m sure we all know, even the new mario kart has a free roam mechanic where you can drive anywhere on the map

but this leads into what i want to call the paradox of open world game design. what i mean by this is the idea that no matter what kind of content, regardless of how much or how little the world is filled with, there’s no way to satisfy all audiences. have what audiences determine as “too little” content and then it’s “barren and pointless and not worth exploring”. fill it with “too much” and then it’s just “another ubisoft slop checklist game that wastes my time”

people say “just fill it with good content”, but the meaning of “good” is so nebulous and fluid that when you ask them to define what that means, you’ll get a million different answers depending on the person

i imagine it’s an extremely difficult situation to navigate during the development process. every dev wants to make the best, most engaging thing they can, but time, deadlines, budget, meddling from shareholders, etc. can all interfere, but that’s a whole different topic for another post.

what do y’all think? what are some games that are, to you, examples of games with a good open world, and what do they do differently from games that you think have a bad or just kinda meh open world that makes them stick out? try to be descriptive if possible",brando-boy,0,2025-06-11 20:01:49,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l92lvs/the_open_world_paradox/,False,True,2025-06-11 20:02:14.319696,2,positive
1171,1l92vph,which gaming system would be safer to use for someone with cubital tunnel in both arms (and tendonitis in right hand)?,"hey all. so i know that i've likely posted on this issue before, but with my symptoms getting a bit more unsettling as i'm going through a transitional period in my life, i felt i should explore the issue again a bit further.

to clarify, i do know for a fact that i have cubital tunnel in my left arm, which is unfortunate and recurring but fairly easy to mitigate. however, with my right arm, there tends to be more uncertainty. i have recurring signs of carpal tunnel and tendonitis in my right hand and upper arm, which i use a brace for. however, lately i've been feeling a clicking sensation in my right elbow, followed by aches and pains in the region if i have it bent for too long or try to straighten it. i've looked into it and it seems to range anywhere from air pockets to further symptoms of tendonitis, which makes me feel that i'll need to keep both arms as straight as possible moving forward.

this proves to be unfortunate for me, as i make a living as a university professor as well as a freelance illustrator. i try everything from heat and ice therapy, tens therapy, massages, acupuncture and even steroid injections- anything to avoid surgery, honestly, which i have heard from colleagues doesn't usually work. ultimately, i need use of my arms to live for day to day activities such as work, cooking and home maintenance, and should save use of my arm for my artwork as well. however, this has me thinking on how i should mitigate my hobby of gaming as well, should i need to keep my arms straight on a regular basis.

currently, i have a surface laptop studio (intel 17 w/ 32gb ram and 6gb graphic card), an outdated surface desktop studio, a nintendo switch, a playstation 4, and a steam deck. there are various controls that i use for each system, but many of them require me to have my arms slightly bent, even if i'm lying down with pillow support. i'm also the kind of person who is looking to travel in the near future; not that i game whenever i'm on the go, but i like the concept of having a system that i can play from multiple locations. i know this is a bit all over the place, but i felt that i should be as forward on the matter as possible, and am open to any input or thoughts people might have on the matter. i'm very open to discussion on what other steps i should take that would benefit me, what systems might be better to use given my circumstances, and what systems i would be better off letting go of. thanks.",mean_emcee,0,2025-06-11 20:12:46,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l92vph/which_gaming_system_would_be_safer_to_use_for/,False,True,2025-06-11 20:13:10.557088,1,neutral

1177,1l93ycx,i'm struggling to find a new fps,"so, quick synopsis, my steam account linked to my activision account was compromised, despite 2fa and steam guard (don't have any malware on my pc, keyloggers, etc. and don't share any login info online, so i took all security measures), and they played with cheats on my account, got me perma banned (ps. i know many don't believe ""someone hacked on my account"", but i have the steam login history to prove it, and it's been a nightmare trying to work through it with activision, steam, etc.), and now....i'm without one of my favorite franchises. 

i know the older games are still pretty active, but the new games are the most consistently active, but i'm banned.

i'm trying to find my new fps game to play or at least mp shooter, but....i'm having a hard time. there are games i kind of bounce back and forth between, like splitgate 2, fragpunk, battlefront 2, rainbow six siege, etc. but i'm kind of having a hard time finding one to replace that hole that cod used to fill. those games had me hooked.

also, the fps games i mentioned are great, but something cod had, which some of these don't have (splitgate 2 and fragpunk) is longevity. cod will never stop, because it's a long running franchise, and is something many new mp games struggle to get is getting a consistent fanbase, and not shutting down, and i fear committing to something that won't be around for a very long time, like cod.

idk. as i said, the games i mentioned are great, and since i don't know if i'll be able to play bo7, i've kind of switched my sights from bo7 to battlefield 6, since that's been kind of my side game to cod. i've always loved battlefield and cod, but stuck to cod more, with bf as a side thing. but bf6 does look awesome, so....i'm excited.

overall, i'm having a hard time sticking to another game because....i've always put all my time into cod, and just making a large switch to commit to another game is hard. i like those other games a lot, but i play them kind of casually, compared to cod.

anyone else ever go this?

ps. i'm trying to work it out with activision and steam and the bbb, but....it's looking grim, and is a very unique situation to all parties. 

pss. i know cod is (depending on your view) in a very rough place, so this may be a good thing, but....idk. i'm not good at letting a problem go. and i could technically make a new account, but i want to stick to the rules and not make the situation worse.",MR_DELORIAN,0,2025-06-11 20:56:38,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l93ycx/im_struggling_to_find_a_new_fps/,False,True,2025-06-11 20:57:05.639288,1,neutral

1213,1l9fsj4,since the 2k mods didn’t want to approve my post here’s the greed that take 2 interactive has each year. this is nba2k discussion on the egregiousness of micro transactions. (this is a gross under-representation aswell. all because the myteam community spends thousands,"it’s late i did a some rough quick math and would like to hear your feedback/thoughts…

let’s do some math. 4.5mil people bought 25. on average let’s say everyone makes 3 builds. (some make one and spend nothing. others i’ve talked to have 15 builds…there are some whales in this game). for simplistic reasons let’s call it 100$/build (which is still kinda accurate after dunk packages clothes etc).

4,500,0003100 = $1,350,000,000…

that is literally just on mycareer micro transactions not including the myteam whales.

they “only made” $270,000,000 from the base game. its actually insane that things have gotten this outrageous. i’d also say that would be a understatement on their income relative to micro transactions.

the craziest part is the servers get discontinued 2-3 years removed from the release date. so instead of having to reinvest in the server department they most likely use the same infer structure ever year. therefore, making their cost of business decrease. how many times will you let this company sell you the same shiny turd each year?",The_Process_Embiid,0,2025-06-12 06:52:27,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l9fsj4/since_the_2k_mods_didnt_want_to_approve_my_post/,False,True,2025-06-12 06:52:50.743220,0,negative

1216,1l9gf3x,why are a lot of shooter games seemingly afraid of creative arsenals?,"this isn't a huge issue, it is just something i find slightly... i dunno, frustrating might be the word.  
but whenever we see new reveals and showcases and the like, it seems extraordinarly rare for any game that includes shooting mechanics to go out of its way to try anything other than the basic when it comes to weaponry.

pistols, machineguns, shotguns, you know the usual.  
there are exceptions of course (for example outer worlds 2 have shown examples of ""non standard"" weaponry) but almost every shooter, 3rd of 1st person seems to plaster  
""assault rifle, smg, sniper"" and so on with little to no variety and it bothers me.

one of the reasons for this post in perticular was how i saw some dead space fans talk about chronos and how it could maybe scratch the itch they crave and my first thought was ""maybe, the starting pistol won't be as satisfying as the plasma cutter however"" and it just made me inspired to make this post.

i dunno, i just wish there was a bit more creativity displayed in the shooter genre is all.

i was hoping i could get some suggestions for games to play that would entertain me until late nov, when i turn 15. i'm not entirely opposed to multiplayer, but since i play on ps5 and don't want to pay ps+, i don't have access to a lot of multiplayer titles.

i've currently played through jedi: survivor, spiderman 2, black myth: wukong and astrobot (plus the free playroom thing). i was hoping i could have some recommendations of games that suit my style (mostly singpleplayer, action/adventure, etc.) that are age appropriate (if you are unsure, just know that if it has semi-regular swearing combined with any heavy violence or nudity, its probably ma15+).

1258,1l9nad8,nintendo simping has gotten out of control?,"in 2025 pointing out that nintendo is better than the industry by avoiding micro transactions or exploitative business practices is... actually right!? yeah i was kidding with the title, the nintendo hate is what has gotten out of control. this video (and its comments) show perfectly how viscous the conversation has gotten since the switch 2 announcements and release. despite the premium price increases, name one industry leader who's doing any better across the board. everyone else is exploiting consumers to grow record profits and still closing your favorite studios. nintendo keeps working hard on quality games for their entire audience, and fights to make their company and their developer jobs sustainable without mtx, battle passes, or premium currency.

i really like that this youtuber purposefully avoids the inflation argument because he knows it isn't appealing to people instinctively. but i do think it's worth mentioning because other companies have compensated for it in other ways for the last decade in either exploitative ways, practices that water down their games for frequent releases and purchases, or in unsustainable direction where they're living on debt and expansionist industry practices that lead them to close studios that can't generate enough profit.

1318,1l9uq4a,"we just launched a full vr roguelite, hexwind, with elemental combat and time-slowing magic—from a small, bootstrapped indie team in canada. aua about meta dev (hint, it ain't easy these days).","hey everyone

we’re **charm games**, a small studio out of **vancouver, canada**, and after a year in early access, we’ve just launched our biggest game yet—**hexwind**, a magic-fueled, time-bending **vr roguelite** now available on **quest 3** and **steamvr**. no ai here, all art and content (and music - shoutout to cory our sound god) created in-house.

hexwind is what happens when you mix:

* *hades*\-style rogue progression
* *superhot*\-style time dilation
* full motion-based **spellcasting** and **wand combat**
* and throw it all into the heart of a magical apocalypse

you fight through procedurally generated chaos rifts, wielding fire, storm, earth, and ice spells, upgrading your loadout between missions, and unlocking perks, potions, and power-ups. every mission feels different. every death teaches you something. and yeah, **you will die a lot**.

this is our third vr game (after *form* and *twilight path*), but this one’s fully self-funded and self-published. no publisher. no corporate safety net. just a small team trying to push what’s possible in vr.

if you’ve ever wanted to *feel* like a battlemage, not just press a button to pretend you are—this is for you.

🎯 try it here   
🌀 [meta quest 3](  
💻 [steamvr](

thanks for checking out our game—reddit feedback has helped shape this project from day one. we’re still updating weekly and reading every comment.

if you’re into vr, roguelikes, or just love seeing what small studios can pull off—give us a shot. and aua if you’re curious about trying to survive as a studio building vr!

1319,1l9urai,i've finally settled on my new obsession while waiting for arc raiders (tldr: i was wrong about dune awakening),"earlier[ i posted asking what people are playing]( while they wait.  i even mentioned dune awakening as something i probably wouldn't be interested in.  i watched a lot of footage and it didn't seem that exciting as an outsider looking into videos of the game, almost boring and bland.  i jumped on battlefront 2 for a while and although the combat ""feel"" was similar, the game annoyed the crap out of me, pvp feels .. odd, it didn't capture my interest for very long.  i had already put my time into division 2 (years ago) and didn't want to revisit that game. 

despite not really being that into the ""dune lore"" or survival games, i pulled the trigger and gave dune awakening a shot anyways ($40 is not a big deal even if its just a few evenings of entertainment is what i told myself).

holy crap am i hooked.  now that i'm actually living in the world, this gorgeous semi-mmo immersive world, i'm realizing why it's getting attention.  it's gorgeous, exploration feels rewarding and dangerous, the game systems (crafting, loot, weapons, abilities) are just deep enough to feel fun to learn, but not too complicated that it feels tedious or frustrating.  the survival element is necessary to make the game feel interesting, but it doesn't feel like a boring survival game where you just have to chop trees all day or whatever trope you're used to from b-tier survival games.  you can tell the devs put a ton of effort and thought into this game and its systems.

i also like that the world has pve and pvp zones, so you have a lot of control about your risk taking and the experience you want. if i could have the mmo system and feel of dune awakening, combined with the world / lore / environments and combat of arc raiders.. i'd be in fucking gaming heaven. 

anyways, if you're not particularly into dune and on the fence about dune awakening and need something to hold you over until october... don't hesitate. it's a great game.",cmndr_spanky,0,2025-06-12 18:58:59,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1l9urai/ive_finally_settled_on_my_new_obsession_while/,False,True,2025-06-12 18:59:12.664545,2,positive

even though khazan is capable of taking down a giant dragon with his bro, in the game, he dies in two hits. i don't really felt how strong khazan is when everything takes about seven or eight big sword slams charged to the maximum that aim straight to their skulls to kill, and he dies to some gentle swings.

soulslike should make people feel that their character was a nobody that eventually takes down demigods through efforts. insread, we get a literally war hero  with a ghost of warriors providing strength, but he would be at the verge of dying when a puppy bites him once.

i miss games like devil may cry where you can get hit multiple times but so do the enemies. you still can't recklessly mashing attack because it's never worth to trade health since you can't heal back hp. so you still have to try yo be better.

1376,1laekxo,ps2 collecting,"my (34m) fiancée’s (42f) birthday is at the end of next month. i really enjoy gift giving. everyone always tells me i’m great at it. it’s fun for me and i love seeing ppl happy. 

this year i decided to go retro for her. she is a huge simpsons fans. she likes the toys, clothes, car accessories and video games. if it’s simpsons themed, she will always love whatever it is. it really doesn’t matter. 

last year i got her the treehouse of horror action 7 action figures. she loved them so very much. this year i decided i was going to get her the treehouse of horror omnibus comic books. i found them, i’m ready to buy them. (ended up choosing to do these for xmas. continue reading for the reason.) 

however, one day her and i were talking about retro gaming. she loves old school games. she has a snes and sega genesis on the retro side. we also have a switch, ps5 and gaming laptop. 

while talking, she mentioned that she would love to play the simpsons hit n’ run again. i started researching on that front after she mentioned that to me a few months ago. 

i ended obtaining a ps2 and everything you’d need to use it and everything to get it to work on our modern tv’s. finding everything in person was preferable and i ended up successfully doing so after traveling through several counties by us. it was an all day event. my brother (37) joined me on my mission, thankfully. he makes everything better, imo. 

so, we got the console, power supply, hdmi converter, wireless controller, ps2 memory card and the simpsons hit n’ run. it ran about $180. i thought it would be more expensive. 

when i got home yesterday (6-12), i hooked everything up, my brother and i tested everything and after tinkering with the (slim) ps2’s video settings, everything worked.

i got overly excited and decided to give her everything early. i presented her with it all and her face lit up like a child on xmas day. we hooked it up in our living room and she played until she had to go to bed. she was very happy and thankful. she went to bed with the biggest smile on her face. 

so, i asked myself if i really did all that so she could play 1 game. i said in my head, there has to be something else i can get for her or myself to make having that ps2 worth while. 

thus, i began researching games and i asked my brother if he remembered any of the psx and ps2 games we played as kids. he mentioned a few and i began perusing the internet for retro games. 

i ended up spending over $380 on ebay yesterday buying a few games and accessories for my fiancee, her daughter, myself and my brother. the 4 most likely to play the ps2. 

here’s what i ended up buying;

1. psx oem memory card
2. ps2 oem memory card
3. ps2 oem multitap
4. 2 wireless controllers
5. yu-gi-oh! forbidden memories
6. marvel ultimate alliance 1+2
7. marvel legends 1+2
8. justice league heroes
9. stars wars ep3 revenge
10. final fantasy x
11. the simpsons game
12. burnout 3: takedown
13. sonic mega collection+
14. dbz budokai 3
15. dbz budokai tenkaichi 3

i was curious if people could suggest some co-op games for my family and i to play together. in our home we have a total of 6 gamers. we all love old games and new. age range is 19-77. the old man prefers genesis over everything else. 

i feel like i bought some good games. we will all have a lot of fun gaming this summer. that’s for sure. 

i just wanna make sure we have a few options other than all the diablo esque games i already bought. 

so, if anyone could suggest some titles that would be amazing. also, if anyone could suggest a reputable online dealer, that would be greatly appreciated.

not to mention mediocre third person shooting with little else involved. so maybe that was what leslie benzies was responsible for, but i find it absolutely hilarious that sites and youtubers are going 

“the missions are boring you just drive from place to place, shooting things” because that’s what open world crime games have been for 25 years.

i hope people remember this energy when gta 6 releases with the same tired ass rockstar mission formula next year. slow walking, cutscenes, driving around and mediocre third person cover shooting.

1395,1laj1lo,i’m in platform limbo at the moment and trying to research what type of games xbox/game pass does best.,"i had a gaming pc but i’m looking to sell it. 

i have a ps5 and a nintendo switch. 

ps5 lately has caught my eye because of ps+ game catalog (kind of like a game pass *lite*, but without day-1 releases and lacking some of the big flagships, e.g., astro bot). 

as a big fan of elder scrolls and fallout games, i recognize the acquisitions of bethesda makes the game pass value rise. and games from obsidian, etc. 

but i also grew up with final fantasy games and there’s a lot on the sony side that makes me feel like ps5 is a good platform to stay on. there are a ton of popular games i never got to play yet either, which i do have some mild interest in, like death stranding, ghost of tsushima, astro bot, etc. so many exclusives, and it seems xbox is more open as a publisher to put their games on playstation now (at a high cost). i typically don’t buy day 1 games. 

generally, what is the consensus of xbox and what game pass does well. are there lots of jrpgs now? western rpgs are its strong suit?  the value of game pass seems clear but i’m really stuck and not sure what to do. don’t you still have to buy all the games’ dlc off game pass too, so you only get the base game anyway?",nichijouuuu,0,2025-06-13 15:36:24,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1laj1lo/im_in_platform_limbo_at_the_moment_and_trying_to/,False,True,2025-06-13 15:36:46.294722,1,neutral

1400,1lak120,elden ring nightreign has changed my life,"buckle up for this one if you like to read.

having never touched the dark souls or elden ring games, playing elden ring nightreign has changed my life.

i was a loyal elder scrolls fan and refused to touch any competitor for that exact reason. sharing a similarity in the phantasy genre, both the elder scrolls and dark souls games have incredible lore and games that take hundreds of hours to fully dive into. elder scrolls was my first love and as a kid i spent dozens of hours mindlessly exploring. i wasn't attached to the combat, just the world and the fact i got to be in it and do whatever i wanted.

after years of oblivion, skyrim and eso, as well as over a decade of waiting for the 6th installment of elder scrolls to drop, i've lost hope there, looking elsewhere for something to fulfill those nostalgic feelings.

however, as i've gotten older, my kiddish imagination has somewhat vanished also. the same enjoyment of wondering around the vast open worlds of elder scrolls games sadly doesn't feel the same without that next level of immersive opportunity i hoped elder scrolls 6 would offer when it came out.

so, i have sat scouring games looking for something similar. many companies have tried to capture that experience the elder scrolls series created. but nothing compared to the world that elder scrolls built, at least that's what i believed.

i had always known about the dark souls series, but the age old conversation always came up of which is better, elder scrolls or dark souls, and both communities swore upon each that they were the best game. i believed, and still somewhat do, that skyrim was the best video game ever created. i routinely argued with my friend about why it didn't matter that elder scrolls combat wasn't the centerpiece of its experience. how nothing compared to the quests and storylines in skyrim, what felt like endless discoveries.

his argument was the exact opposite. skyrim felt simple with little effort to be exerted. the combat offered nothing to invest in, requiring little energy to be effective. these arguments pushed me away from dark souls games even more because i thought, ""they must've sacrificed so much to focus on the combat.""

however, they both shared something that transcended that argument. that was the lore. the lore in both series is incredible. this, i would have never knew without elden ring nightreign.

everybody knows we've faced a drought of truly well-made games. million dollar budgets going to micro transactions and exploitative schemes to keep gamers attention. so, when elden ring nightreign dropped with none of these exploitative schemes, but a base price with all content accessible within the game through playing, i thought why not? let's try it. what do i have to lose.

made the purchase and loaded up my first run. got pulverized immediately. all i could do is follow two random people around like a lost puppy. however, these random people led me to what has changed my life. a new world to discover. characters and storylines that have captured me and given me a reappreciation for creativity, causing an emotional investment i haven't felt in years. this which has worked to restore the imagination i've lost.

i've searched for that feeling for years, but preconceived notions built in by my pride in the elder scrolls series stole that experience from me.

the devs really cooked with nightreign, because i believe it was made for someone like me. someone who needed the elden ring and dark souls series this whole time but have been convinced otherwise. the combat was never something to be afraid of, but something to fall into especially now as an adult who finds satisfaction in completing a difficult task.

now, having spent hours watching lore videos, learning about all the amazing bosses, studying their movesets and delving into this rich world, i can't wait to purchase elden ring and relive the nostalgia of my past through a whole new world, a purpose to game, something i would've never even considered without elden ring nightreign. so this game will forever hold a special place in my heart and i owe it this to encourage everyone who shares any of the same experiences i have to try it. maybe just like me, its that thing you've been searching for.",DadsUpset,1,2025-06-13 16:16:10,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lak120/elden_ring_nightreign_has_changed_my_life/,False,True,2025-06-13 16:22:55.948545,2,positive

1410,1lalqe0,"the next step imo in gaming in general, should be cross progress of account stats(not including purchases ofc) such as achievements.","i've been thinking about this for a while and the whole market would get a boost thanks to this.

let's be honest, how many of us pc players prefer steam over epic, yes steam is a better platform but if i want a game on epic(imagine random bought exclusive #134) i will less inclined to buy it since it won't show on my main platform, same as my old achievements rotting in my ps4 or playtime, it's as if they don't exist. 

but if let's say on steam(my main platform) there could be an option to link our public profiles from other platforms and include play time/achievements i would be more willingly to pay for other platforms.

now with playstation giving us steam users access to their games(except a few of them and older games), imagine with this, pc players would more willingly get a ps4 to play said games not avaiable, maybe bloodborne(yes we want it 60fps but not everyone needs it), or also older games such as jak and dexter, the rachet and clank games that haven't come to pc, sly cooper, the whole mario(copium needed here)

this would also work between consoles such as xbox and ps5. there's good ""exclusives"" between them and it's a shame that our gameplay info is still locked to the platform and not the game.

but they’re not the only ones. even in some big rpgs, you realize most “choices” just tweak a scene or two before everything goes back on track like nothing happened. it kills replayability and kind of breaks immersion.

now while covid fucked over basically every indistry, a ton of entertainment industries saw record-breaking profits during those years. people were indoors all day, depressed and wanted something to distract them from the plague going on outside. they were playing more games, streaming more shows, and so gaming and streaming companies made loads of money.

so then logically, after covid had mostly ended, they would go back to regular business, making the same profits they did before lockdown. if you had any sense you'd recognize that and be okay with a dip in revenue. but these short-sighted morons are still trying to chase infinite growth. the line always has to go up, so what do you do?

you cut corners, you increase prices, you layoff workers.

that's why we've seen so many more big company layoffs these past couple years. why youtube is thinking of making longer unskipable ads. why league of legends is selling $500 skins. why netflix is getting more expensive. why video games are bumping up to $80 standard.

what do you do? do you take a break to play those games that are considered works of art, or do you simply continue your routine and take advantage of future offers?

now games just seem much easier. i think about og pokémon. having to train each pokémon individually, versus now you get like auto exp share to the entire team. so not only do some of the technical aspects of games seem easier, but even grinding aspects.

1540,1lblo8n,i think nintendo should actively encourage switch 2 exclusive updates for 3rd party switch 1 titles to make that thing more attractive,"new games are so expensive that it would be a blessing if there was at least more of a pull factor with backwards compatibility. 

with pc or ps4 ports which already exist as 1080p\_60 versions, publishers could very easily add ""experimental"" options which become available if the game detects the switch 2. like, tinkering with lighting and textures would be significant work, but increasing rendering resolution to 1080p would be managable and unlocking the framerate to 60 (or even 90/120 for 2d indies) should be like two lines of code.

at a bare minimum, they would just add those toggles for 60fps and 1080p, and if both or only one of those work is the issue of the player (like on pc). alternatively, they can of course actually test it and introduce a higher fixed rate like 45fps for example to get stable 1080p, or 900p for 60fps. that would vastly improve stuff like batman arkham, doom or red dead for very little investment.

nintendo should encourage that by highlighting any switch 1 games which were improved for free in their own eshop category for a certain timeframe and mark them with a special badge or something.",Alias_X_,0,2025-06-14 23:05:14,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lblo8n/i_think_nintendo_should_actively_encourage_switch/,False,True,2025-06-14 23:05:31.591889,2,positive
1541,1lblxo0,i always see people complaining about this gen sucking and ps5 with “no games” so i try comparing generations to see how we stack up,"i compare by first full year, since consoles release typically at the end of the year, i just combine the extra month or two with the following year for the first year. 

i used high profile games for each year so we can see where we’re at and compare. i think most people aren’t aware of how good we’re actually doing, despite a pandemic heavily affecting things!!

we are four years into things, and we’re doing way better than i thought.",BadNewsBearzzz,0,2025-06-14 23:17:23,gaming,Unknown,https://i.redd.it/7y5ighg37z6f1.jpeg,False,False,2025-06-14 23:17:42.515381,0,negative
1542,1lbml87,is ai art fine if devs have no artistic ability?,"for context i’m a dev working with a team trying to explore solutions to a workflow problem… they have tried to acquire 2d talent and have failed. they need 2d images made for a core part of the game that cannot be made in house. 

options:

- change the design approach to not need these images, likely diminishing their design goals and negatively affecting gameplay

- use ai to generate the necessary images. 

ai art is reasonably disliked, but when does/can it get a pass in a game? 

assuming it’s used and there is a constant attempt to find the artists able to replace them, if they are still there for release, would that upset you? would you not want to play despite the overall game being enjoyable? 

thanks!",Growth_Moist,0,2025-06-14 23:49:26,gaming,Unknown,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lbml87/is_ai_art_fine_if_devs_have_no_artistic_ability/,False,True,2025-06-14 23:49:44.974029,1,neutral
